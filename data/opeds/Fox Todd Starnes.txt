A permit is required before students can talk about Jesus at North Carolina State University, according to a lawsuit filed in federal court.

Grace Christian Life, a registered student group at NC State, filed suit over a policy requiring a permit for any kind of student speech or communication anywhere on campus – including religious speech.

In September 2015, the student group was told that without a permit, they must stop approaching other students inside the student union to engage in religious discussions or invite them to attend group events.

“It’s an amazingly broad speech restriction, Alliance Defending Freedom attorney Tyson Langhofer told me. “Public universities are supposed to be the marketplace of ideas, not places where students need a permit just to exercise their constitutionally protected freedoms.”

Alliance Defending Freedom is a law firm that specializes in religious liberty cases. They allege the Christian group has been singled out by the university.

“The University has not restricted the ability of other students and student groups to engage in expressive activity,” the lawsuit states. “Grace has witnessed other students, student groups and off-campus groups handing out literature either without a permit or outside of the area reserved by their table permit.”

A university spokesperson did not return my calls seeking comment.

NC State’s rules were so draconian that the Christians were not even allowed to step from behind their table in the student union.

“Colleges are supposed to be places where ideas are freely shared – not gagged,” Grace Christian Life President Hannalee Alrutz told me. “The only permit a student needs to speak on campus is the First Amendment.”

It’s true that the university does regulate student speech – written, oral or graphic.

ADF points to Regulation 07.25.12 that “requires a permit for any form of commercial or non-commercial speech, which the policy broadly defines as ‘any distribution of leaflets, brochures, or other written material, or oral speech to a passersby (sic)…’”

“The policy specifics that any person ‘wishing to conduct any form of solicitation on University premises must have the written permission of the Student Involvement (Office) in advance,” ADF noted.

According to the lawsuit, a university official sent an email to another official concerned about the Christian club.

“There is an individual named Tommy who works for Grace who is essentially soliciting throughout the building,” the email reads. “He walks up to a single person or duo of persons, starts with a hello and then starts the conversation into religion, ending with giving them a card.”

The email goes on to explain how they’ve stopped other groups from engaging in similar behavior in order to “create that inclusive, welcoming environment.”

In other words, the only way to be truly inclusive and welcoming is to shut down the Christians and shove them into a closet.

The lawsuit also provides some context on the university’s attitude towards Christian ministry during the time that Grace came under attack.

Grace was a member of Chaplain’s Cooperative Ministry, an independent, interfaith organization that supported individual campus ministries and planned jointly sponsored interfaith programs.

In October 2015, a university official met with the CCM to advise the group “on the speech restrictions imposed by the Speech Permit Policy.”

Solicitation is not allowed when conversation is initiated under one pretense different from the intended purpose…inviting involvement in a certain ministry,” the university official said in written minutes of the meeting.

In November 2015, the university dissolved its relationship with CCM because “the current environment of diversity and faith traditions within the university is not shown or mirrored well within CCM as it currently exists.”

The lawsuit did not elaborate on the problematic “faith traditions” -- but typically that means “Evangelical Christians.”

ADF tried unsuccessfully to convince NC State to drop its unconstitutional speech policies – but they refused – hence the lawsuit.

“The courts have well established that a public university can’t require permits in this manner for this kind of speech – and certainly can’t enforce such rules selectively,” ADF Senior Counsel David Hacker said. “Unconstitutional censorship is bad enough, but giving university officials complete discretion to decide when and where to engage in silence students makes the violation even worse.”

Kudos to Grace Christian Life for standing up to a bunch of academic bullies who want to silence Christian voices. And thank goodness for bold believers like Miss Alrutz.

“I think this is an attack on my liberty as a citizen of the United States,” she told me – warning that every freedom-loving American should be concerned.

“If they could do it to us – they could do it to anybody,” she said.
There is something a bit unsettling about watching violent, foul-mouthed protesters waving the Mexican flag on American soil.

Over the weekend, Hispanic children lined the streets in Fort Wayne, Indiana – hurling filthy insults at Donald Trump supporters.

 “F*** you,” the youngsters shouted as they flipped off passerby. “F*** you.”

Video captured images of the angry protesters wearing sombreros and holding signs that read, “Brown Pride.”

What kind of a parent would allow their child to behave that way in public?

A similar protest turned violent last week in Southern California – as a horde of illegals and their supporters violently attacked Trump supporters, police and even a horse.


NOW PLAYING
Far left violence out of control in America
Never autoplay videos
Yes, a horse.

Cole Bartiromo, identified by local media as a Trump supporter, needed a half-dozen stiches after the mob bashed open his head.

“Suddenly, out of nowhere I felt this thud in the front of my head,” Bartiromo told CBLA.com. “I started panicking – getting scared, thinking, ‘When are they going to stop? Are they going to kill me? I mean, these aren’t rational people.’”

The California mob spilled into the streets – blocking roadways and smashing police cars. They intended to shut down a Trump rally. They intended to silence Mr. Trump and his supporters.

They were angry about the wall he plans to build – to secure our border from the invading **horde** of illegals. They were angry about Mr. Trump speaking the truth – about how illegals are killing Americans – on American soil.

One of the most disturbing images in recent days came from California – a small child – holding a sign. It read, “Make America Mexico Again.”

There was a time in this nation’s history when having 13 million people breach your border would have been considered an invasion. We used to fight wars over such a hostile act.

But these days instead of repelling the invaders, the Obama administration gave them food stamps, free health care, and a voter registration card.

We’ve been invaded and our government has provided aid and comfort to the enemy.

In both Indiana and California the protesters tried to bully and intimidate law-abiding Americans into silent submission. They tried – but they failed.

You see, the illegals need to understand something – “We the People” will no longer be silent. We will not allow our sovereignty to be violated anymore.

The American taxpayers have reached a boiling point. We are tired of illegals taking American jobs. We are tired of illegals living off our tax dollars. We are tired of illegals causing mayhem in our streets.

And more than anything, we are tired of lawmakers who refuse to defend American sovereignty.

The truth is we don’t know who or what has been coming across our southern border. We don’t know what dangers lurk in our neighborhoods.

And we want a president who will put American lives first. We want a president who will do whatever it takes to keep our families safe. We want a president who will defend our sovereignty.

And if I see one more foul-mouthed protester waving a Mexican flag on American soil – I’ll personally donate a pile of bricks to help build Mr. Trump’s wall.


What sort of man is lurking deep inside Donald Trump’s innards?

We were led to believe that Mr. Trump was one of us -- a conservative of the gun-toting, Bible-clinging variety.

But friends, Mr. Trump is no conservative. His talk is far different from his walk.

Fox News confirms that senior campaign aides assured Republicans in private that the Trump we’ve seen on the campaign trail is not going to be the same Trump we get in the White House. 

“When he’s out on that stage, when he’s talking about the kinds of things he’s talking about on the stump, he’s projecting an image that’s for that purpose,” Trump strategist Paul Manafort said behind closed doors.

“You’ll start to see more depth of the person, the real person,” he added. “You’ll see a real different guy.”

The Associated Press reported that Trump’s aides mentioned the need to “moderate his brash personality.”

“The part that he’s been playing is evolving into the part that now you’ve been expected, but he wasn’t ready for, because he had first to complete the first phase,” Manifold said. “The image is going to change.”

Evolving? Projecting an image? Moderating?

Back in the South those are code words for snookered, two-faced and phony-as-a-two-dollar-bill.

Oh, Donald. What have you done? Say it isn’t so.

“Donald Trump is telling the American people that he’s lying to us,” Sen. Ted Cruz said on the campaign trail Friday. “His campaign is now run by Washington lobbyists.”

If true, Mr. Trump is no different than the Establishment Republicans who so effortlessly betrayed and abandoned the base of the party. 

The man is campaigning as a conservative — but I’d be willing to bet a pair of Corinthians that he’s secretly plotting to govern as a liberal. 

So the question must be asked. When will we see the “real” Donald Trump? 

Will he still send the illegals back from whence they came? Will he still make Mexico pay for the wall? Will he really bring jobs back to the United States? Will he defend the American working man?

And what does it mean when his campaign says he will “moderate” his message?

Mr. Trump promised to “Make America Great Again.” Does he really mean that — or does he just want to “Make America Average”?

In just the past few days we’ve seen him begin to waffle on issues like abortion and religious liberty. 

Pro-life groups are extremely concerned by comments he made about rewriting the party’s pro-life platform. 

He also spoke out against North Carolina’s decision to strike down Charlotte’s so-called bathroom bill. 

“The problem with what happened in North Carolina is the strife and the economic punishment that they’re taking,” he said on the "Today Show."
With all due respect, the problem in North Carolina was big business trying to bully and intimidate moms and dads who want to protect their daughters.

“In the last 48 hours, Donald Trump has come out for grown men going into the bathrooms with little girls,” Cruz said. “That is politically correctness on steroids.”

In the Broadway musical, “The Music Man” the good-hearted people of River City got snookered by a fast-talking swindler named Harold Hill.

Hill enthralled the town folk with tales of depravity – of a culture gone astray. There’s trouble in River City, he famously proclaimed. Trouble with a capital “T”.

He promised that he had the cure for what ailed their town — and they bought what he was selling hook, line and sinker. 

And I’m afraid conservatives have suffered the same fate as the good people of River City. 

There’s trouble in America, folks. Trouble with a capital “T”.
Bi-vocational pastors be warned – what you say from the pulpit on Sunday could get you fired from your public sector job on Monday.

Dr. Eric Walsh, a renowned public health expert who also serves as a lay minister, has filed a federal lawsuit against the Georgia Department of Public Health alleging he was terminated for delivering sermons on issues ranging from homosexuality to evolution.

“No one in this country should be fired from their job for something that was said in a church or from a pulpit during a sermon,” said First Liberty attorney Jeremy Dys.

First Liberty, one of the nation’s largest law firms defending religious liberty, is representing the Seventh Day Adventist lay minister. 

They contend that the Georgia Department of Public Health assigned workers to investigate sermons Dr. Walsh delivered on health, marriage, sexuality, world religions, science and creationism. He also preached on what the Bible says about homosexuality.

“He was fired for something he said in a sermon,” Dys told me. “If the government is allowed to fire someone over what he said in his sermons, they can come after any of us for our beliefs on anything.”

First Liberty has accused the government agency of religious discrimination and retaliation.

“I don’t believe I did anything wrong,” Dr. Walsh told me in an exclusive interview. “This has been very painful for me. I really am a strong believer in the Constitution. But now I feel like maybe all these ideals and values that I was raised to believe – the ideals they country was founded upon – no longer exist.”

A spokesperson for the Georgia Department of Public Health (DPH) did not return telephone calls nor did they respond to email inquiries.

First Liberty said Walsh was hired as a district health director on May 7, 2014. A few days later, DPH officers and other government workers began investigating his religious activities.

“DPH officers and other employees spent hours reviewing these and other of Dr. Walsh’s sermons and other public addresses available online, analyzing and taking notes on his religious beliefs and viewpoints on social, cultural and other matters of public concern as expressed in the sermons and other public addresses,” the lawsuit states.

The behavior of the DPH was so egregious that its own counsel twice warned them on May 15 that “under federal law Dr. Walsh’s religious beliefs could play no role in any employment decision by DPH.”

But on May 16, the DPH announced it had rescinded the job offer that Dr. Walsh had already accepted.

“Today’s action by the department follows a thorough examination of Dr. Walsh’s credentials and background as well as consultation with the six local boards of health which comprise the district,” spokesman Ryan Deal said in a news release.

And the Department of Public Health wasn't the only organization concerned about the pastor's sermons. 
The Georgia Voice reported that the Health Initiative, an Atlanta-based group committed to LGBT health issues, strongly opposed Welsh’s hiring.  

“Dr. Walsh’s public displays of anti-gay propaganda and religious rhetoric will become symbols of the department and will further isolate an already vulnerable population. We believe this hire is detrimental to the wellbeing of our community, as well as to the effectiveness of the Department to conduct meaningful outreach to LGBT Georgians,” Executive Director Ellis told the publication.

Based on documents First Liberty obtained through a FOIA request, it is clear there was some internal concerns about how Dr. Walsh had been treated.

In spite of the DPH’s internal witch hunt against Dr. Walsh, at least one unnamed staffer wrote a memo warning that the entire controversy had been blown “impossibly out of proportion.”

“Not only is there no smoking gun, there is every reason to believe, even from his detractors own words, that he is the excellent health director we believed he would be,” the staffer wrote in a document obtained by First Liberty through a FOIA request.

“If we do not hire this applicant on the basis of the evidence of job performance and disqualify him on the basis of discrimination by those who seek to advance their own agenda and do him harm, I believe we are no better than they are,” the staffer concluded.

The unnamed staffer’s concerns were ignored and Dr. Walsh was terminated.

Dr. Walsh was catapulted into the national spotlight earlier in 2014 when he was invited to deliver the commencement address at Pasadena City College in California.  

Walsh, who was then the director of the city’s public health department, came under fierce scrutiny from LGBT activists and students. He backed out of the speaking engagement. But critics persisted and he was forced to resign his post – after reaching a financial settlement with the city.

Dys tells me that what happened to Dr. Walsh should give every American the chills.

“The idea of those government employees dividing up the sermons is unthinkable,” he said. “Religious liberty means we should be able to find sanctuary in our own sanctuary.”

In recent days, the state of Georgia has become a battleground over religious liberty.

Governor Nathan Deal, a Republican, vetoed legislation that would have provided protection for pastors and other faith-based organizations from attacks by LGBT activists. The veto was levied under fierce pressure from big business bullies like Disney and Coca-Cola.

It’s unclear whether such a law would have protected Dr. Walsh.

“Any law a state passes that helps protect religious liberty – especially a law that allows pastors the right to preach and not lose their jobs – is a law we would certainly apply in this case,” Dys said.

It’s becoming clear to me that people of faith – people like Dr. Walsh -- will not find safe refuge in the state of Georgia.

First, they silenced the sheep – and now they are trying to silence the shepherds. 

When it comes to pandering nobody does it better than Hillary Clinton – who is desperate to become the nation’s first black female president.

In her latest outreach to New York City’s black voters, Mrs. Clinton told hip-hop radio show hosts that she carries a bottle of hot sauce in her purse.

It was an apparent homage to a lyric in “Formation,” Beyonce’s latest hit song. Or as Hot Sauce Hillary calls her, “Bay-on-say.” But I’ll get to that little faux pas later.

“I got hot sauce in my bag, swag,” is how the song goes.

Mrs. Clinton’s revelation that she likes it a little spicy came as a surprise to the hosts of Power 105.1’s Breakfast Club.

Here’s a transcript of the conversation between Hot Sauce Hillary and the hosts of Breakfast Club on Power 105.1:

Angela: “What’s something that you always carry with you?”

Mrs. Clinton: “Hot sauce…”

Well, it turns out that she really does like hot sauce – a lot.

The Clinton campaign confirmed to Time magazine that Mrs. Clinton enjoys an array of spicy foods – from chili flakes to jalapenos. To be fair her love affair with hot sauce goes back 20 years. Her current favorite is apparently something called “Ninja Squirrel.”  

Regardless, her on-air admission was met with skepticism in the media.

It was a “clear attempt to snag New York’s black vote,” TMZ opined.

I would’ve demanded that she produce the bottle – but that’s probably why she refuses to come onto my radio program.

Continuing with the transcript:

Charlamagne Tha God: “Hot sauce in my bag, swag.”

Mrs. Clinton: “Hot sauce.”

Charlamagne Tha God: “Now, I just want you to know people are going to see this and say, ‘okay, she’s pandering to black people.”

Mrs. Clinton: “Is it working?”

No, it's not working. What in the name of Texas Pete is she thinking?

Last January, she was named the radio station’s “Donkey of the Day” for being inauthentic and for pandering to black people, the Washington Post reports.

Charlamagne said Hot Sauce Hillary was trying to reach black voters in a “Grandma trying to be hip kinda way.”

I’m just glad she didn’t beatbox the theme song to the “Fresh Prince of Bel Air.”

Now – about that unfortunate incident involving Hot Sauce Hillary butchering Beyonce’s name. She was speaking at a town hall gathering and called Beyonce, “Bay-on-say.”

“A lot of black people feel like they can’t trust you because you mispronounced Beyonce’s name,” Charlamagne said.

It’s not the first time Hot Sauce Hillary has pandered to black communities across the fruited plain – dropping her “g’s” above and below the Mason-Dixon Line.

There was the time she changed her Twitter logo to represent Kwanzaa. And then there was the time she had chicken and waffles in South Carolina.

Truth be told – I'd be willing bet a jug of sweet tea Hot Sauce Hillary couldn’t tell the difference between a collard green and a turnip green.

And how could we forget her cringe-worthy recitation of an African-American spiritual – delivered in a church house with a faux black dialect?

“Ah don’t feel no ways tired…” Hot Sauce Hillary told an enthusiastic congregation. “Ah come too far…”

Sweet mercy, America. It's like she's turning into Tyler Perry's Madea.
