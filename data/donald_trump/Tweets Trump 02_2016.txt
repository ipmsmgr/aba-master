Join us Saturday night- for the South Carolina Primary Watch Party!
#SCPrimary #Trump2016 https://t.co/AqRhLydI0u Join us tomorrow night in Charleston, South Carolina! #SCPrimary #Trump2016 https://t.co/VauoRmgcVz RT @benshapiro: Pope on Trump: "A person who thinks only about building walls...is not Christian." This is Vatican City. https://t.co/ehmsL… RT @Drudge_Report_: Most #restrictive #immigration, #citizenship policies of any nation in world... https://t.co/401Iun7sbp RT @TomOdell: .@FoxNews - Pope who lives in a Vatican city fortified with huge walls thinks it's wrong to build walls? Really? https://t.co… Response to the Pope:
https://t.co/iWDjTIQyhE I agree with Marco Rubio that Ted Cruz is a liar! .@FoxNews is changing their  theme from "fair and balanced" to "unfair and unbalanced." But dying @WSJ is worse.Their phony poll is a  joke! Thank you South Carolina! Together, WE WILL MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! #VoteTrumpSC https://t.co/ZkXPm9lPL1 #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/nrcrU08sQ6 Thank you America! #Trump2016
https://t.co/U9L0ja3frk https://t.co/oqv2dSa1ET New CBS National Poll just out - massive lead for Trump. The Wall Street Journal/NBC Poll is a total joke. No wonder WSJ is doing so badly! I love being in South Carolina. We are leading big in all of the State polls - Saturday is a BIG day. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! The just out USA Today National Poll, where I lead by big numbers, shows that in a head to head matchup, I beat both Hillary and Bernie. Amazing that while I lead by big numbers in the new Q and and USA Today polls, the the press only wants to report on the phony WSJ/NBC poll. Join us tomorrow in Kiawah, South Carolina! #SCPrimary #VoteTrumpSC

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/TRrdR0nlpM Thank you Nevada! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/n6hGfdCWuv #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/uMLm0Gd3lX Jeb Bush just got contact lenses and got rid of the glasses. He wants to look cool, but it's far too late. 1% in Nevada! Just out Nevada poll shows Jeb Bush at 1%, he should take his dumb mouthpiece, @LindseyGrahamSC, and just go home. .@FoxNews is so biased it is disgusting. They do not want Trump to win. All negative! I will beat Hillary easily, but Lindsey Graham says I won't, and yet he got zero against me- no cred! Why does FOX put him on? .@lindseygraham, who had zero in his presidential run before dropping out in disgrace- saying the most horrible things about me on @FoxNews. Interesting how President Obama so haltingly said I "would never be president" - This from perhaps the worst president in U.S. history! "@ChJLuc91: @YomasterJon @RichardTBurnett  Scary how smoothly Cruz looks into the camera and lies about Trump, CANT be #POTUS! #Trump2016" "@babo_sirin: BUSTED AGAIN: @TedCruz in Hot Water Over Possibly Illegal Fundraising #SCPrimary https://t.co/aaTtAbfOXx" The guy is bad news Why does @megynkelly devote so much time on her shows to me, almost always negative?  Without me her ratings would tank. Get a life Megyn! "@debdew2:  @brithume @megynkelly @DiamondandSilk FOX: TRUMP HATERS R SCARED BECAUSE THEY LOSE -  TRUMP IS WINNING https://t.co/6umGLYjWhT" Thank you  @kayleighmcenany for your nice words - great knowledge and style! We are doing really well in South Carolina. @CNN @donlemon "@Good2bqueen67:  @brithume @megynkelly They're too lame to get it, Sir. When you win the election they'll get it." .@brithume thinks that when Republicans drop out of the race, someone will pick up ALL of that vote. The fact is I will get much of it! Explain to @brithume and @megynkelly, who know nothing, that I will beat Hillary and win states (and dem-indie votes) that no other R can! Will be interviewed by @StephenAtHome tonight by phone- a late show first @CBS @colbertlateshow. Enjoy! 
#Colbert #LSSC Thank you, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/pIDqnY4IL3 Thank you to the 2,500+ in North Augusta, South Carolina. Lines down the block!

An amazing day in South Carolina! #VoteTrumpSC Thank you! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/tIBB3BMUvp New PPP Poll just out - Trump up big, Cruz, Rubio and Bush down. The debate results, even with a stacked RNC audience, were wonderful! Spent the full day at meetings and a major rally yesterday in South Carolina. Great people and spirit. Today will be more of the same. New South Carolina poll from PPP. Thank you! #VoteTrumpSC https://t.co/6618Oi6vle What a night! 10,000 amazing supporters in Greenville, South Carolina! THANK YOU!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/cykncrrSRE RESPONSE TO THE LIES OF SENATOR CRUZ: https://t.co/9PGo56YTqt
#Trump2016 #VoteTrumpSC JEB is a hypocrite! Used massive private "Eminent Domain" --- Just another clueless politician! 
https://t.co/yZT3lSutt9 Jeb used Eminent Domain &amp; took advantage of a disabled vet in the process. (2/2)
https://t.co/eiBCld77tV I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue &amp; never revealed that he used Eminent Domain- when criticizing me! (1/2) Now that George Bush is campaigning for Jeb(!), is he fair game for questions about World Trade Center, Iraq War and eco collapse? Careful! I will be in South Carolina all week. Saturday is BIG, BIG, BIG! Get out and vote - MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN Jeb Bush and Ted Cruz are not electable presidential candidates, Hillary would destroy them. Ted may not be eligible to run - born in Canada Funny that Jeb(!) didn't want help from his family in his failed campaign and didn't even want to use his last name.Then mommy, now brother! Ted Cruz, along with Jeb Bush, pushed Justice John Roberts onto the Supreme Court. Roberts could have killed ObamaCare twice, but didn't! Wow, in the new CBS Poll I went way up into the forties! Thank you! Tickets for future debates should be put out to the general public instead of being given to the lobbyists &amp; special interests - the bosses! Loved the debate last night, and almost everyone said I won, but the RNC did a terrible job of ticket distrbution. All donors &amp; special ints Thank you for your support! TOGETHER we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! 
https://t.co/fFN9pisyQ4 https://t.co/VxyuDwZmC9 I will be on Face the Nation with John Dickerson on CBS this morning. Enjoy! This shows what a complete &amp; total liar Ted Cruz is- he said he wouldn't have nominated John Roberts. Really? https://t.co/gBnsNgomom "@autumnandews08: @realDonaldTrump @JebBush Jeb is incompetent and will lose, don't waste your energy on that cry baby!" Even though every poll, Time, Drudge etc., has me winning the debate by a lot, @FoxNews only puts negative people on. Biased - a total joke! "@jeffpaine:  @realDonaldTrump you crushed the debate! Thank you! #GOPDebate #GoogleTrends https://t.co/yVxFubckNs Hey @glennbeck- see how I beat your boy Ted- in your own Blaze poll? Your endorsement means nothing! #GOPDebate #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/Cwp6Ub5GqJ All polls have me winning debate big- Drudge, TIME, etc. Dopey Charles Krauthammer still nasty. He has zero cred- totally dishonest! How can @JebBush beat Hillary Clinton- if he can't beat anyone else on the #GOPDebate stage with $150M? I am the only one who can! Thank you! I miss my father.  https://t.co/1IPVwX0avU Lightweight @JebBush said tonight he didn't know his family used private eminent domain in Texas- Lie! 
#GOPDebate On the way to the #GOPDebate with my wonderful wife @MelaniaTrump.
https://t.co/SnOnu6IHTC https://t.co/f0C429tvHO Ted Cruz is a cheater! He holds the Bible high and then lies and misrepresents the facts! Nasty Ted Cruz is at it again- same dirty tricks he used w/ @RealBenCarson- saying I may not be on ballot &amp; I hold liberal positions. LIES! Wow! Honored to be chosen by the highly respected + accurate Washington &amp; Lee Mock Convention. I hope you are right - I will make you proud! The totally unexpected loss of Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia is a massive setback for the Conservative movement and our COUNTRY! Love the people of South Carolina - look very much forward to the debate tonight.

Great insight Totally unauthorized, do not pay. I am self funding my campaign! Notice has just been withdrawn. #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain The RNC, which is probably not on my side, just illegally put out a fundraising notice saying Trump wants you to contribute to the RNC.

https://t.co/8MQ4imuTTi Just got back from Tampa. It was an amazing evening with an even more amazing crowd - fantastic people! Will be in South Carolina tomorrow. Word is that little Morty Zuckerman’s @NYDailyNews loses more than $50 million per year---can that be possible? When little Morty Zuckerman closes his failing @NYDailyNews will I at least be given some credit? Will happen soon. 11,000 inside venue tonight in Tampa! Broke record set by Elton John in 1988 w/out musical instruments! Another 5,000 outside. Will be back! I will end illegal immigration and protect our borders! We need to MAKE AMERICA SAFE &amp; GREAT AGAIN! #Trump2016
https://t.co/wd3LlMz01I #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! https://t.co/7zuMD4oxUq Millions of $'s of false ads,  paid for by lobbyists-special interests of cheater @SenTedCruz  and sleepy @JebBush, are now running in S.C. "@copyover2001: @realDonaldTrump   Do Americans really want a Canadian-born president? First non native born in history?" "@by @tedcruz good I want to see the court decide what I was always told "natural born" means - born on American soil" "@hillx123: @tedcruz you have just been put on notice @realDonaldTrump We Stand with you... #MakeAmericaGreatAgain" Thankyou. Last time lightweight @JebBush tried to knock off @marcorubio he made a total fool of himself. If he doesn't do better this time, he is out! If @TedCruz doesn’t clean up his act, stop cheating, &amp; doing negative ads, I have standing to sue him for not being a natural born citizen. Lightweight @JebBush is spending a fortune of special interest against me in SC. False advertising- desperate and sad! After hearing the news that they would not be able to extort $1M from me, they went hostile w/ a series of incorrect &amp; ill-informed ads. Nothing conservative about the Club for Growth coming into my office and demanding a $1M contribution, which naturally, they did not get. You must be registered Republican by February 16th to vote TRUMP in the Florida primary. https://t.co/xZzUkjV3lL
https://t.co/lPuprzJBQ5 The failing @NYDailyNews, destroyed by little Morty Zuckerman, is preparing to close and save face by going online. It's dead! NEVADA! Tomorrow is the deadline to register Republican.

Message from @IvankaTrump: https://t.co/SZTq1QOXEg How can Ted Cruz be an Evangelical Christian when he lies so much and is so dishonest? Lying Cruz put out a statement, “Trump &amp; Rubio are w/Obama on gay marriage." Cruz is the worst liar, crazy or very dishonest. Perhaps all 3? Weak JEB getting thrown out by management during speech. Do you think he will be this tough on Putin &amp; others?  https://t.co/Tqej1euLVL THANK YOU- Baton Rouge, Louisiana! WE will #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! #Trump2016 https://t.co/XV7EIe7A2l Just landed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana. Reports are out that lines are three quarters of a mile to get in. Wow! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain Cruz caught cold in lie after denial of push polls like lies w/ @RealBenCarson. How can he preach Christian values? https://t.co/p3yGL02ABA "@truthinvest: @CNN @tedcruz @realDonaldTrump Ted Cruz is the definition of sleaze. Just ask @RealBenCarson" Heading to Baton Rouge, Louisiana for a speech. Expecting a very large crowd! See you soon. #Trump2016 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain We are getting reports from many voters that the Cruz people are back to doing very sleazy and dishonest "pushpolls" on me. We are watching! Jeb failed as Jeb! He gave up and enlisted Mommy and his brother (who got us into the quicksand of Iraq). Spent $120 million.Weak-no chance! He (or she) who hesitates is lost: MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Remember, it was the Republican Party, with the help of Conservatives, that made so many promises to their base, BUT DIDN'T KEEP THEM! Hi DT .@MarkHalperin showed a focus group on @Morning_Joe me using a very bad word. I never said the word, left an open blank. Please apologize! Jeb Bush spent more than $40,000,000 in New Hampshire to come in 4 or 5, I spent $3,000,000 to come in 1st. Big difference in capability! There are no buyers for the worthless @NYDailyNews but little Mort Zuckerman is frantically looking. It is bleeding red ink - a total loser! I have been consistent in my opposition to Common Core. Get rid of Common Core--- keep education local! THANK YOU- Clemson, South Carolina! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #SCPrimary https://t.co/FgACmaFxxc "@HARyder: Which is it @realDonaldTrump ?Are you planning on getting rid of Common Core or keeping it?  Get rid of it fast. I was referring to the fact that Jeb Bush wants to keep common core. Big speech tonight in South Carolina - 7:00 P.M. Tremendous crowd! So funny, Jeb Bush called me a "highly gifted politician and a great entertainer" - I assume that is a compliment! Such a great experience in New Hampshire - amazing people! Will be leaving for a big event in South Carolina today. Like the worthless @NYDailyNews, looks like @politico will be going out of business. Bad reporting- no money, no cred! Worthless @NYDailyNews, which dopey Mort Zuckerman, is desperately trying to sell, has no buyer! Liabilities are massive! Dopey Mort Zuckerman, owner of the worthless @NYDailyNews, has a major inferiority complex. Paper will close soon! "@MarkHalperin: My report card grades for the 2 New Hampshire winners: DonaldTrump A: v strong energy/close. BernieSanders B+: went too long Thank you to the people of  New Hampshire, I love you! Now, off to South Carolina. Thank you, New Hampshire! Departing with my amazing family now! #FITN #NHPrimary
https://t.co/rbFfcq8gQq https://t.co/73aoZk8uMG We will stop heroin and other drugs from coming into New Hampshire from our open southern border. We will build a WALL and have security. We will immediately repeal and replace ObamaCare - and nobody can do that like me. We will save $'s and have much better healthcare! ISIS is making big threats today - no respect for U.S.A. or our "leader" - If I win it will be a very different story,with very fast results New Hampshire vote today -  MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #FITN https://t.co/pbt7gDaw7y MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:40. A.M. Enjoy! The polls are now showing that I am the best to win the GENERAL ELECTION. States that are never in play for Repubs will be won by me. Great! No-one has done more for people with disabilities than me. I have spent many millions of dollars to help out-and am happy to have done so! I know the "Governors" and Jeb Bush, who has gone nasty with lies, is by far the weakest of the lot. His family used private eminent domain! Remember @JebBush wants COMMON CORE (education from D.C.) and is very weak on ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION ("come as act of love"). Not a leader!
