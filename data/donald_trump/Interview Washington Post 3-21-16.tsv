1	FREDERICK RYAN JR., WASHINGTON POST PUBLISHER	 Mr. Trump, welcome to the Washington Post. Thank you for making time to meet with our editorial board.		
3	Donald Trump	 New building. Yes this is very nice. Good luck with it.		
5	RYAN	 Thank youâ€¦ Weâ€™ve heard youâ€™re going to be announcing your foreign policy team shortlyâ€¦ Any you can share with us?		
7	Donald Trump	 Well, I hadnâ€™t thought of doing it, but if you want I can give you some of the namesâ€¦ Walid Phares, who you probably know, PhD, adviser to the House of Representatives caucus, and counter-terrorism expert; Carter Page, PhD; George Papadopoulos, heâ€™s an energy and oil consultant, excellent guy; the Honorable Joe Schmitz, [former] inspector general at the Department of Defense; [retired] Lt. Gen. Keith Kellogg; and I have quite a few more. But thatâ€™s a group of some of the people that we are dealing with. We have many other people in different aspects of what we do, but thatâ€™s a representative group.		
9	FRED HIATT, WASHINGTON POST EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR	 Do you want to start out?		
11	Donald Trump	 No, other than to say, weâ€™re working hard, I think weâ€™re all in the same business of trying to make our country better, a better place, so we have something in common. Iâ€™ve been treated very, very badly by The Washington Post, but, you know, I guess â€” and Iâ€™m your neighbor, Iâ€™m your neighbor right down the road, in fact weâ€™re actually giving a press conference there in a little while, I think your people are going to be there. And by the way, Bob Costa is an excellent reporter, Iâ€™ve found him to be just an excellent reporter. I should tell you, because I have to give you the good and the bad. Not that he does me any favors, because he doesnâ€™t, but heâ€™s a real professional.		
13	So weâ€™re having a news conference today in the new building thatâ€™s going up, and the building is very much ahead of schedule, because it was supposed to open two years from September, and weâ€™re going to open it in September. We could open it actually sooner but weâ€™re going to break it in a little bit, so weâ€™re going to open it in September, and itâ€™s under budget, even though weâ€™ve increased the quality of the finishes substantially, marble finishes, very high quality of marble, so weâ€™re under budget and ahead of schedule. And Iâ€™m, you know, I am that way when I build, I know how to build, I know how to get things done.			
15	The GSA [General Services Administration], I will say, GSA has been very professional, theyâ€™ve been very, very professional. They chose us overâ€”I think they had more than 100 people who bid, you can imagine, because of the location, but they had over 100 people that bid, and it was broken down into ten finalists, and I got it. We got it because of the strength of my financial statement and also because of the strength of what we were proposing. So weâ€™re having a news conference there today. What time is that, Hope?			
17	HOPE HICKS, Donald Trump CAMPAIGN SPOKESPERSON	 Itâ€™s at 2	15	
19	Donald Trump	2	15. I hear a lot of the press is going to be there, weâ€™re going to give them a tour of the building. Itâ€™s still a little bit rough â€” as an example, a lot of the marble surfaces all have sheetrock covering, and plywood covering on them, so a lot of people wonâ€™t see as much as they think. Itâ€™ll be like a miracle, you take it off and it explodes, like itâ€™s finished, right? But thatâ€™ll be a fun news conference.	
21	HIATT	 If I could, Iâ€™d start by asking is there a secretary of state and a secretary of defense in the modern era who you think have done a good job? Who do you think were the best?		
23	Donald Trump	 Well, because I know so many of them, and because in many cases I like them, I hate to get totally involved. I think George Shultz was very good, I thought he was excellent. I can tell you, I think your last secretary of state and your current secretary of state have not done much. I think John Kerryâ€™s deal with Iran is one of the worst things that Iâ€™ve ever seen negotiated of any kind. Itâ€™s just a horrible giveaway.		
25	HIATT	 What in particular?		
27	Donald Trump	 Well, I think, number one, we shouldnâ€™t have given the money back. I think, number two, we should have had our prisoners before the negotiations started. We should have doubled up the sanctions. We should have gone in and said, â€˜release our prisoners,â€™ they would have said â€˜no,â€™ and we would have said, â€˜double up the sanctions,â€™ and within a short period of time we would have had our prisoners back. And I think that was a terrible mistake. I think giving the money back was a terrible mistake. And by the way they are not using the money on us, they are not buying anything from us, theyâ€™re buying, you noticed, they didnâ€™t buy Boeing, they bought Airbus, 118 planes from what I understand, but they bought them all from Airbus, they go out of their way not to spend any money in our country. So I wouldnâ€™t have done that. And I think itâ€™s going to just lead, actually, to nuclear problems. I also think itâ€™s going to be bad for Israel. Itâ€™s a very bad deal for Israel.		
29	HIATT	 George Shultz, itâ€™s interesting, was associated with a foreign policy of Reagan that was very much devoted to promoting democracy and freedom overseas. Is that something you think in todayâ€™s world the United States should be doing?		
31	Donald Trump	 I do think itâ€™s a different world today and I donâ€™t think we should be nation building anymore. I think itâ€™s proven not to work. And we have a different country than we did then. You know we have 19 trillion dollars in debt. Weâ€™re sitting probably on a bubble and, you know, itâ€™s a bubble that if it breaks is going to be very nasty. And I just think we have to rebuild our country. If you look at the infrastructure â€” I just landed at an airport where, not in good shape, not in good shape. If you go to Qatar and if you go to (inaudible) you see airports the likes of which you have never seen before. Dubai, different places in China. You see infrastructure, you see airports, other things, the likes of which you have never seen here.		
33	HIATT	 Short of nation building, is there any role in promoting values or democracy? Or thatâ€™s not somethingâ€¦		
35	Donald Trump	 Well, there is, I just think that we have values in our country that we have to promote. We have a country that is in bad shape, itâ€™s in bad condition. You look at our inner cities, our inner cities are a horrible mess. I watched Baltimore, I have many, many friends in Baltimore, we watched what happened. St. Louis, Ferguson, Oakland, it could have been much worse over the summer. And it will probably be worse this summer. But you look at some of our inner cities. And yet you know I watched as we built schools in Iraq and theyâ€™d be blown up. And weâ€™d build another one and it would get blown up. And we would rebuild it three times. And yet we canâ€™t build a school in Brooklyn. We have no money for education, because we canâ€™t build in our own country. And at what point do you say hey, we have to take care of ourselves. So, you know, I know the outer world exists and Iâ€™ll be very cognizant of that but at the same time, our country is disintegrating, large sections of it, especially in the inner cities.		
37	HIATT	 So what would you do for Baltimore, letâ€™s say.		
39	Donald Trump	 Well, number one, Iâ€™d create economic zones. Iâ€™d create incentives for companies to move in. Iâ€™d work on spirit because the spirit is so low, itâ€™s incredible, the unemployment, you look at unemployment for black youth in this country, African American youth, is 58-59 percent. Itâ€™s unthinkable. Unemployment for African Americans â€“ not youth, but African Americans â€“ is very high. And I would create in the inner cities, which is what I really do best, thatâ€™s why when I open a building and I show you itâ€™s way ahead of schedule, under budget and everything elseâ€”I think it was the Rite Aid store, the store in Baltimore it took them 20 years to get it built, one store, and then it burned down in one nightâ€”we have to create incentives for people to love what they are doing, and to make money. And to create, you know, to really create a better life for themselves. And you canâ€™t â€“ it doesnâ€™t seem right that you will have a situation like Baltimore, and many other places, letâ€™s use Baltimore as an example, there are many Baltimores in this country. Detroit is maybe even a better example than Baltimore. But that youâ€™ll have a situation like that, and then weâ€™re over nation building with other, with countries that in many cases donâ€™t want us there. They want our money, but they donâ€™t want us.		
41	HIATT	 The root of many peopleâ€™s unhappiness in Baltimore was the perception that blacks are treated differently by law enforcement. And the disproportionate â€“ do you think itâ€™s a problem that the percentage of blacks in prison is higher than whites, and what do you think is the root of that situation?		
43	Donald Trump	 Well Iâ€™ve never really see anything that â€“ you know, I feel very strongly about law enforcement. And, you know, if you look at the riot that took place over the summer, if that were stopped â€“ it all, it mostly took place on the first evening, and if that were stopped on the first evening, you know, youâ€™d have a much nicer city right now, because much of that damage and much of the destruction was done on Evening One. So I feel that law enforcement, itâ€™s got to play a big role. Itâ€™s got to play a big role. But thatâ€™s a pretty good example, because tremendous amounts of damage was done that first evening â€“ first two evenings, but the first evening in particular. And so Iâ€™m a very strong believer in law enforcement, but Iâ€™m also a very strong believer that the inner cities can come back.		
45	HIATT	 Do you see any racial disparities in law enforcement â€“ I mean, what set it off was the Freddie Gray killing, as you know. Is that an issue that concerns you?		
47	Donald Trump	 Well, look, I mean, I have to see what happens with the trial. Iâ€”		
49	HIATT	 Well, forget Freddie Gray, but in general, do you believe there are disparities in law enforcement?		
51	Donald Trump	 Iâ€™ve read where there are and Iâ€™ve read where there arenâ€™t. I mean, Iâ€™ve read both. And, you know, I have no opinion on that. Because frankly, what Iâ€™m saying is you know we have to create incentives for people to go back and to reinvigorate the areas and to put people to work.  And you know we have lost million and millions of jobs to China and other countries. And theyâ€™ve been taken out of this country, and when I say millions, you know itâ€™s, itâ€™s tremendous. Iâ€™ve seen 5 million jobs, Iâ€™ve seen numbers that range from 6 million to, to smaller numbers. But itâ€™s many millions of jobs, and itâ€™s to countries all over. Mexico is really becoming the new China. And I have great issue with that. Because you know I use in speeches sometimes Ford or sometimes I use Carrier â€“ itâ€™s all the same	 Ford, Carrier, Nabisco, so many of the companies â€” theyâ€™re moving to Mexico now. And you know we shouldnâ€™t be allowing that to happen. And tremendous unemployment, tremendous. Theyâ€™re allowing tremendous people that have worked for the companies for a long time, theyâ€™re allowing, if they want to move around and they want to work on incentives within the United States, thatâ€™s one thing, but when they take these companies out of the United States. Other countries are outsmarting us by giving them advantages, you know, like in the case of Mexico. In the case of many other countries. Like Ireland is, youâ€™re losing Pfizer to Ireland, a great pharmaceutical company that with many, many jobs and itâ€™s going to move to Ireland.	
53	RUTH MARCUS, COLUMNIST	 But Mr. Trump, if I could just follow up on Fredâ€™s question. I think that what he was trying to get at was the anger in the African American community that held some of the riots and disturbances this summer about disparate treatment and about â€¦ clearly you say youâ€™ve read where there is disparate treatment. But it is pretty undeniable that there is disproportionate incarceration of African Americans vs. whites. What would you â€“ is that something that concerns you?		
55	Donald Trump	 That would concern me, Ruth. It would concern me. But at the same time it can be solved to a large extant with jobs. You know, if we can rebuild those communities and create incentives for companies to move in and create jobs. Jobs are so important. There are no jobs. There are none. You go to those communities and you canâ€™t â€“ there is nothing there. There is no incentive for people. It is a very sad situation. And what makes it even sadder is that we are spending so much money in other countries and our own country has vast pockets of poverty and a lot of this is caused by the fact that there are no jobs. So we can create jobs in places like Baltimore and Detroit. You know, Detroit made a move, but I donâ€™t know but it just seems to be fizzling. I donâ€™t know what is going on. I watched Detroit four, five years ago and it looked like they were really putting a full-court press on and it doesnâ€™t seem to be, from what Iâ€™ve been told, friends of mine that are very much involved in that whole process that it doesnâ€™t seem to be, doesnâ€™t seem to be something that is being pursued like it should be pursued. But if we can create jobs, it will solve so many problems.		
57	CHARLES LANE, EDITORIAL WRITER/COLUMNIST	 Can I follow up on that? I mean, to take the case of Baltimore, I mean one of the things thatâ€™s so remarkable about Baltimore and Detroit is that both of these cities, like many others have been â€“ itâ€™s not as if no one has ever said before we should have economic zones, itâ€™s not as if no one has ever said before we need incentives and taxes etc., etc. And Baltimore received a lot of federal aid over the years. So I guess the question, then, is whatâ€™s different specifically about your approach to these issues from whatâ€™s been tried in the past, because a lot of effort has been put in just the direction you just described.		
59	Donald Trump	 I think whatâ€™s different is we have a very divided country. And whether we like it or not, itâ€™s divided as bad as Iâ€™ve ever seen it. Iâ€˜ve been, you know, Iâ€™ve been doing things for a long time. I see it all the time. I mean I see it so often. I see it when we go out and we have 21,000 people in Phoenix, Arizona, the other day, the division â€“ not so much Phoenix, because that was actually very smooth, there wasnâ€™t even a minor, they did block a road, but after that, that was Sheriff Joe Arpaio, when the road was unblocked everyone left and it was fine. But in Tucson, you can see the division. You can see the division. Thereâ€™s a racial division thatâ€™s incredible actually in the country. I think itâ€™s as bad, I mean you have to say itâ€™s as bad or almost as bad as itâ€™s ever been. And thereâ€™s a lack of spirit. And one thing I thought that would happen, and it hasnâ€™t happened, unfortunately, I thought that President Obama would be a great cheerleader for the country. And it just hasnâ€™t happened. I mean we can say it has. But it hasnâ€™t happened. When you look at the Ferguson problems and the Baltimore problems and the Detroit problems. And you know thereâ€™s a lack of spirit. I actually think Iâ€™d be a great cheerleader â€“ beyond other things, the other things that Iâ€™d do â€“ I actually think Iâ€™d be a great cheerleader for the country. Because a lot of people feel itâ€™s a hopeless situation. A lot of people in the inner cities they feel that way. And you have to start by giving them hope and giving them spirit and that has not taken place. Just has not taken place.		
61	RYAN	 Mr. Trump, youâve mentioned many times during the campaign, in fact including this morning, instances you feel where the press has been biased or unfair or outright false in their reporting, and youâve mentioned that you want to âopen upâ the libel laws. Youâve said that several times.		
63	Donald Trump	 I might not have to, based on Gawker. Right?		
65	[CROSSTALK]			
67	Donald Trump	 That was an amazingâ€”		
69	RYAN	 My question is not so much why you feel they should be open but how. What presidential powers and executive actions would you take to open up the libel laws?		
71	Donald Trump	 Okay, look, Iâ€™ve had stories written about me â€“ by your newspaper and by others â€“ that are so false, that are written with such hatred â€“ Iâ€™m not a bad person. Iâ€™m just doing my thing â€“ Iâ€™m, you know, running, I want to do something thatâ€™s good. Itâ€™s not an easy thing to do. I had a nice life until I did this, you know. This is a very difficult thing to do. In fact Iâ€™ve always heard that if youâ€™re a very successful person you canâ€™t run for office. And I can understand that. Youâ€™ll do a hundred deals, and youâ€™ll do one bad one or two bad ones â€” thatâ€™s all they read about are the bad ones. They donâ€™t read about the one hundred and fifty great ones that you had. And even some of the ones they write that are good, they make them sound bad. You know, so Iâ€™ve always heard that. Iâ€™ve heard that if youâ€™re successful â€“ very successful â€“ you just canâ€™t run forâ€”		
73	RYAN	 But how would you fix that? Youâ€™ve said that you would open up the libel laws.		
75	Donald Trump	 What I would do, what I would do is Iâ€™d â€“ well right now the libel laws, I mean I must tell you that the Hulk Hogan thing was a tremendous shock to me because â€“ not only the amount and the fact that he had the victory â€” because for the most part I think libel laws almost donâ€™t exist in this country, you know, based on, based on everything Iâ€™ve seen and watched and everything else, and I just think that if a paper writes something wrong â€” media, when I say paper Iâ€™m talking about media. I think that they can do a retraction if theyâ€™re wrong. They should at least try to get it right. And if they donâ€™t do a retraction, they should, they should you know have a form of a trial. I donâ€™t want to impede free press, by the way. The last thing I would want to do is that. But I mean I can only speak for â€“ I probably get more â€“ do I, I mean, you would know, do I get more publicity than any human being on the earth? Okay? I mean, [Editorâ€™s note	 Trump points at Ruth Marcus] she kills me, this one â€“ thatâ€™s okay, nice woman.

79	Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump has said several times he would "loosen up" libel laws. Listen to his response when The Washington Post editorial board asked him how, exactly, he would change them, which includes discussion of violence against protesters. (Gillian Brockell,James Downie/The Washington Post)			
80	RYAN	 Would you expand, for example, prior restraints against publications?		
82	Donald Trump	 No, I would just say this. All I want is fairness. So unfair. I have stories and you have no recourse, you have no recourse whatsoever because the laws are really impotent.		
84	MARCUS	 So in a better world would you be able to sue me?		
86	Donald Trump	 In a better world â€” no â€” in a better world I would be able to get a retraction or a correction. Not even a retraction, a correction.		
88	RYAN	 Well, now, youâ€™ve been a plaintiff in libel suits so you know a little bit of the elements â€¦		
90	Donald Trump	 I had one basic big libel suit, it was a very bad system, it was New Jersey. I had a great judge, the first one, and I was going to win it. And then I had another good judge, the second one, and then they kept switching judges. And the third one was a bad judge. Thatâ€™s what happened. But, uhâ€¦		
92	RYAN	 But thereâ€™s standards like malice is required. Would you weaken that? Would you require less than malice for news organizations?		
94	Donald Trump	 I would make it so that when someone writes incorrectly, yeah, I think I would get a little bit away from malice without having to get too totally away. Look, I think many of the stories about me are written badly. I donât know if itâs malice because the people donât know me. When Charles writes about me or when Ruth writes about me, you know, weâve never really met. And I get these stories and theyâre so angry and I actually say, I actually say, âHow could they write?â â and many stories I must tell you, many stories are written that with a brief phone call could be corrected before theyâre written. Nobody calls me.		
96	STEPHEN STROMBERG, EDITORIAL WRITER	 How are you defining âincorrect?â It seems like youâre defining it as fairness or your view of fairness rather than accuracy.		
98	Donald Trump	 Fairness, fairness is, you know, part of the word. But you know, Iâve had stories that are written that are absolutely incorrect. Iâll tell you now and the word âintentâ, as you know, is an important word, as you know, in libel. Iâll give you an example. Some of the media, not all of it, but some of it, is very, very strong on â you know I get these massive crowds of people, and weâll get protesters. And these protesters are honestly, theyâre very bad people. In many cases, theyâre professionals. Highly trained professionals. And I will rent an arena for 20,000 seats and they will come in â because thereâs really no way â how you going to be able to tell â somebody said âoh you shouldnât let âem inâ â how you gonna know, you know? They walk in. [Inaudible] So we had an incident this weekend, which was amazing in Tucson, Arizona where a man, a protestor, wearing a Ku Klux Klan outfit, another one dragging an American flag, was walking out of the arena, and an African American man who was a supporter was sitting there listening to the speech and we had to stop because they were so loud â theyâre so loud, these people, I donât know what they do, theyâre trained voices or something. And theyâre walking up and you saw it, because it was all over television, and the African American man became incensed I think the guy said something to him like you know what, like âscrew you,â okay? Or worse. I think, because he looked over to him and said something to him and the guy just had it. Now, they were together, these two. The one wearing a Ku Klux Klan, the other dragging a flag or something, but the African American man, who I think was an Air Force person, I just read he had a pretty stellar life so far. And he just became incensed. So when I saw the television yesterday early in the morning I saw the Ku Klux Klan, I saw exactly what happened. By the time it got on to the national shows that was for the most part taken out. They just had this African American smacking, you know, fighting. And it didnât make sense, you know, why, why. But if you saw it in the morning it made a lot more sense. We donât condone violence at all but itâs very, very unfair reporting and we, you knowâ¦		
100	HIATT	 Sorry, when you say we donâ€™t condone violence â€”		
102	Donald Trump	 I say that.		
104	HIATT	 You say that. But youâve also said, âIn the good old days, he would have been ripped out of his seat so fast, you wouldnât believe it.â Isnât that condoning violence?		
106	Donald Trump	 No, because what I am referring to is, weâve had some very bad people come in. We had one guy â and I said it â he had the voice â and this was what I was referring to â and I said, âBoy, Iâd like to smash him.â You know, I said that. Iâd like to punch him. This guy was unbelievably loud. He had a voice like Pavarotti. I said if I was his manager I would have made a lot of money for him, because he had the best voice. I mean, the guy was unbelievable, how loud he was. And he was a swinger. He was hitting people. He was punching and swinging and screaming â you couldnât make â so you have to stop. You know, there is also something about the First Amendment, but you had to stop. And, so, this one man was very violent and very loud. And when he was being taken out, he walked out like this, with his finger way up, like, âscrew everybody.â And thatâs when I made that statement. He was absolutely out â I mean, he hit people and he screamed and then he was walking out and heâs giving everybody the finger. And they donât talk about that. See, they donât talk about that. They say, âDonald, wait a second, Donald, donâtâ â		
108	HIATT	 But your answer is you condone violence when the guy is really egregious and terrible?		
110	Donald Trump	 No, I condone strong law and order. Iâ€™ll tell you what they â€”		
112	HIATT	 Rip him out of his seat, punch him in the face, isnâ€™t that violent?		
114	Donald Trump	 Well he punched other people.		
116	HIATT	 No, I understand that.		
118	Donald Trump	 Fred, he punched other people. He was punching people. He was â€” one guy was, you know, Iâ€™d like to say â€”		
120	JO-ANN ARMAO, ASSOCIATE EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR	 The Fayetteville protester who was sucker punched â€” he didnâ€™t punch anyone â€”		
122	Donald Trump	 No.		
124	ARMAO	 He was being escorted from police, and he was sucker punched.		
126	Donald Trump	 No. When are you talking about? When?		
128	ARMAO	 In Fayetteville.		
130	COREY LEWANDOWSKI, Donald Trump 2016 CAMPAIGN MANAGER [to Trump]	 North Carolina.		
132	Donald Trump	 I donâ€™t know. I donâ€™t know which one.		
134	ARMAO	 Yes you do.		
136	Donald Trump	 I donâ€™t know. Because weâ€™ve had so many â€”		
138	ARMAO	 Thatâ€™s the gentleman you said you were going to look into to see whether or not to pay his legal fees.		
140	Donald Trump	 Oh well thatâ€™s a different â€” thatâ€™s different from the one Iâ€™m talking about. This one was about a month ago. This one was before Fayetteville.		
142	ARMAO	 Well, okay, Fayetteville, do you condone violence in that case â€”		
144	Donald Trump	 No I donâ€™t, no I donâ€™t, thatâ€™s different â€”		
146	ARMAO	 Where the protester is being walked out â€”		
148	Donald Trump	 By the way, thatâ€™s different â€”		
150	ARMAO	 But, yet, you explained it that he was giving the finger and so he provoked it, so he got sucker punched. And you are going to possibly pay for his legal expenses.		
152	Donald Trump	 He did give the finger, and â€”		
154	ARMAO	 So thatâ€™s okay?		
156	Donald Trump	 Well, a lot of people donât â you know, the finger means, âF you.â A lot of people think â and you have children there, you have a lot of children that go, you know, they go with their parents â a lot of people think thatâs very inappropriate. I mean, you know â		
158	ARMAO	 Itâ€™s certainly inappropriate.		
160	Donald Trump	 Well, I think it is.		
162	ARMAO	 But does it â€” is it â€” does it qualify to â€”		
164	Donald Trump	 So do you let him â€”		
166	ARMAO	 â€” to punch him in the face?		
168	Donald Trump	 Again I donâ€™t condone it. So do you let him walk out, heâ€™s holding up his finger, telling everybody. Same thing happened, you know, the last one in â€”		
170	HIATT	 I guess the question is, when you then offer to pay the guyâ€™s legal fees, isnâ€™t that â€”		
172	Donald Trump	 I didnâ€™t offer â€”		
174	HIATT	 Isnâ€™t that condoning?		
176	Donald Trump	 No, I didnâ€™t offer, Fred â€”		
178	HIATT	 You said you would consider it â€”		
180	Donald Trump	 I said I want to look into it. I said I want to look into it. I didnâ€™t say that.		
182	HIATT	 Isnâ€™t that condoning?		
184	Donald Trump	 No, I donâ€™t think so.		
186	HIATT	 Doesnâ€™t that convey a message of approval?		
188	Donald Trump	 Donâ€™t think so.		
190	LEWANDOWSKI	 To be fair, before every event, there is a public service announcement made about â€”		
192	Donald Trump	 Itâ€™s true.		
194	LEWANDOWSKI	 â€” any potential protesters. That is made to everybody that says â€”		
196	Donald Trump	 Strong.		
198	LEWANDOWSKI	 â please do not engage these protesters. You know, they may cause a disturbance. Please do your best, let local law enforcement handle this or security at that venue. The problem becomes, with a massive crowd of twenty or thirty or forty thousand people, the resources that are there donât have the ability to get to all these people in a manner before the crowd reacts, because the agitators are inciting those people. So we are very clear at the onset, that there is a loud public notice that says, âplease do not engage these people, please let them do their job, and let the local law enforcement deal with that.â Thatâs said at the very front end at every event.		
200	Donald Trump	 Very loud, and itâs repeated over and over. Actually, I guess itâs on tape, but they repeat it over and over. One thing that was interesting this weekend. We had in Phoenix, Arizona, we had an interesting incident. We had people, we had a major highway coming into the arena. Itâs not an arena, itâs a huge open space, 60 acres, and it was packed. And we had a major highway coming in, and people â protesters â stopped their car in the middle of the highway, chained themselves to their cars, and the cars â blocked. They were there for a while. A car was not able to move. They were backed up for 20 â I mean, like, just forever. And, it was terrible. And they were very abusive, screaming, you know, âscrew you, screw you, pigs, pigsâ â meaning to the cops. Sheriff Joe Arpaio â now that was his territory. Okay, heâs a tough cookie. Sheriff Joe saw this, he gave them a couple of minutes to move their car â they didnât move them â cut the chains, arrested the people and just moved the cars over. I donât know how they did it â just, they were gone in minutes after he came there. Minutes. It was amazing how quick. They actually had chains around their necks. They didnât even know why they were there. People â somebody was interviewed, âWhy are you here?â âWell, I donât know, Iâm not sure.â They didnât even know.		
202	Nobody ever talks about these people. They say, âOh, Trump had a bad rally,â or something. You know there are two sides to it, and honestly, there is really one side of it â because you see how bad this was. So what happened is they arrested three people. There were probably a hundred or a hundred-fifty protesters, there were 21,000 people there, there were 150 protesters that were creating havoc. As soon as the three people were arrested, everybody else ran. That was the last we heard, and I made a speech for, you know, a half hour, 45 minutes â not one person stood up and started screaming at this speech. It was sort of an amazing thing.			
204	Now Tucson was different. Different police force, different level of, you know, whatever, and we had numerous interruptions during the speech. You know, Iâ€™ll be speaking, Iâ€™ll be ready to make a point, and a guy will stand up and start, just screaming. Out of â€” from nowhere, for, like, no reason. Not even screaming things that make sense, and often screaming tremendous obscenities.			
206	I know [Lewandowski] went in â he took a lot of heat a couple of days ago in that same rally because he went in to get â to quiet people down, and they had a couple of signs âF-youâ â it just said âF-you,â meaning the word spelled out, and you have cameras there, you know, itâs on live television, and you have guys holding signs saying âF-you Trumpâ or just âF-you,â and they had numerous of those â there were, you know, probably ten of those signs throughout the arena.			
208	And he went in to say, please would you move the sign, and the woman in front â€“ and I saw it â€“ this guy grabbed the woman in front, okay, he [Lewandowski] hardly touched him â€“ he took him â€“ If he touched him at all it was just grabbing the shirt a little bit. But the guy was a real wiseguy. And he was screaming obscenities. He did grab the woman in front and ultimately he was led out by the security guy, who was right behind him.			
210	But the reason is that the police were slow to get there. And the point is this	 Youâre making a speech and you have guys getting up saying, [Editorâs note	 Trump says the next few words in a hushed voice] âfuck you,â and the whole place goes, âWhoa,â and it incites the place. They incite the place, because then everyone goes, âUSA, USA.â Thatâs why theyâre all screaming âUSA, USA,â or âTrump, Trump, Trump.â	
212	You can have 20,000 people and you can have like two people. Usually â€“ itâ€™s amazing â€“ usually itâ€™s one person. I mean, itâ€™s like they stage it. Itâ€™s very professional. They have like one person here, one person here, one person.			
214	Okay, weâre talking about the media. So, Iâve never seen the media cover it from that angle. Itâs always, âTrump had aâ â and hereâs the big thing, I mean, honestly, essentially nobody has heard			
216	HIATT	 But just â€“ given the Supreme Court rulings on libel â€” Sullivan v. New York Times â€” how would you change the law?		
218	Donald Trump	 I would just loosen them up.		
220	RUTH MARCUS	 What does that mean?		
222	[Crosstalk]			
224	Donald Trump	 Iâd have to get my lawyers in to tell you, but I would loosen them up. I would loosen them up. If The Washington Post writes badly about me â and they do, they donât write good â I mean, I donât think I get â I read some of the stories coming up here, and I said to my staff, I said, âWhy are we even wasting our time? The hatred is so enormous.â I donât know why. I mean, I do a good job. I have thousands of employees. I work hard.		
226	Iâm not looking for bad for our country. Iâm a very rational person, Iâm a very sane person. Iâm not looking for bad. But I read articles by you, and others. And, you know, weâve never â we donât know each other, and the level of hatred is so incredible, I actually said, âWhy am I â why am I doing this? Why am I even here?â And I donât expect anything to happenâ			
228	RYAN	 Would that be the standard then? If there is an article that you feel has hatred, or is bad, would that be the basis for libel?		
230	Donald Trump	 No, if itâ€™s wrong. If itâ€™s wrong.		
232	RYAN	 Wrong whether thereâ€™s malice or not?		
234	Donald Trump	 I mean, The Washington Post never calls me. I never had a call, âWhy â why did you do this?â or âWhy did you do that?â Itâs just, you know, like Iâm this horrible human being. And Iâm not. You know, the one thing we have in common I think we all love the country. Now, maybe we come at it from different sides, but nobody ever calls me. I mean, Bob Costa calls about a political story â he called because weâre meeting senators in a little while and congressmen, supporters â but nobody ever calls.		
236	RYAN	 The reason I keep asking this is because youâ€™ve  said three times youâ€™ve said we are going to open up the libel laws and when we ask you what you mean you say hatred, or badâ€“		
238	Donald Trump	 I want to make it more fair from the side where I am, because things are said that are libelous, things are said about me that are so egregious and so wrong, and right now according to the libel laws I can do almost nothing about it because Iâ€™m a well-known person you know, etc., etc.		
240	JACKSON DIEHL, DEPUTY EDITORIAL PAGE EDITOR	 Back to foreign policy a little bit, can you talk a little bit about what you see as the future of NATO? Should it expand in any way?		
242	Donald Trump	 Look, I see NATO as a good thing to have â€“ I look at the Ukraine situation and I say, so Ukraine is a country that affects us far less than it affects other countries in NATO, and yet we are doing all of the lifting, theyâ€™re not doing anything. And I say, why is it that Germany is not dealing with NATO on Ukraine? Why is it that other countries that are in the vicinity of the Ukraine not dealing with â€” why are we always the one thatâ€™s leading, potentially the third world war, okay, with Russia? Why are we always the ones that are doing it? And I think the concept of NATO is good, but I do think the United States has to have some help. We are not helped. Iâ€™ll give you a better example than that. I mean, we pay billionsâ€“ hundreds of billions of dollars to supporting other countries that are in theory wealthier than we are.		
244	DIEHL	 Hundreds of billions?		
246	Donald Trump	 Billions. Well if you look at Germany, if you look at Saudi Arabia, if you look at Japan, if you look at South Korea  â€” I mean we spend billions of dollars on Saudi Arabia, and they have nothing but money. And I say, why? Now I would go in and I would structure a much different deal with them, and it would be a much better deal. When you look at the kind of money that our country is losing, we canâ€™t afford to do this. Certainly we canâ€™t afford to do it anymore.		
248	DIEHL	 About Ukraine, was it right for the United States to impose sanctions on Russia when they invaded Crimea and would you keep those sanctions on them?		
250	Donald Trump	 I think the answer is yes, it was, but I donâ€™t see other people doing much about it. I see us doing things about it, but I donâ€™t see other people doing much about it.		
252	DIEHL	 And could I ask you about ISIS, speaking of making commitments, because you talked recently about possibly sending 20 or 30,000 troops andâ€”		
254	Donald Trump	 No I didnâ€™t, oh no no no, okay, I know what youâ€™re saying. There was a question asked to me. I said that the military, the generals have said that 20- to 30,000. They said, would you send troops? I didnâ€™t say send 20,000. I said, well the generals are saying youâ€™d need because they , what would it take to wipe out ISIS, I said pretty much exactly this, I said the generals, the military is saying you would need 20- to 30,000 troops, but I didnâ€™t say that I would send them.		
256	DIEHL	 If they said that, would you go along with that and send the troops?		
258	Donald Trump	 I find it hard to go along withâ€”I mention that as an example because itâ€™s so much. Thatâ€™s why I brought that up. But a couple of people have said the same thing as you, where they said did I say that and I said that thatâ€™s a number that I heard would be needed. I would find it very, very hard to send that many troops to take care of it. I would say this, I would put tremendous pressure on other countries that are over there to use their troops and Iâ€™d give them tremendous air supporters and support , because we have to get rid of ISIS, okay, just so â€” we have to get rid of ISIS. I would get other countries to become very much involved.		
260	DIEHL	 What about China and the South China Sea. What do you think theyâ€™re up to andâ€”		
262	Donald Trump	 I think itâ€™s a terrible situation, I think itâ€™s terrible they have no respect forâ€“		
264	DIEHL	 â€“and what should we do about it?		
266	Donald Trump	 Well look, we have power over China and people donât realize it. We have trade power over China. I donât think we are going to start World War III over what they did, it affects other countries certainly a lot more than it affects us. Butâand honestly, you know part ofâI always say we have to be unpredictable. Weâre totally predictable.  And predictable is bad. Sitting at a meeting like this and explaining my views and if I do become president, I have these views that are down for the other side to look at, you know. I hate being so open. I hate when they say â like I said get rid of the oil, keep the oil, different things over the years, when people are saying what would you do with regard to the Middle East, when we left â We should have never been in Iraq. It was a horr- it was one of the worst decisions ever made in the history of our country. We then got out badly, then after we got out, I said, âKeep the oil. If we donât keep it Iranâs going to get it.â And it turns out Iran and ISIS basicallyâ		
268	HIATT	 How do you keep it without troops, how do you defend the oil?		
270	Donald Trump	 You wouldâ€¦ You would, well for thatâ€“ for that, I would circle it. I would defend those areas.		
272	HIATT	 With U.S. troops?		
274	Donald Trump	 Yeah, I would defend the areas with the oil.  And I would have taken out a lot of oil. And, uh, I would have kept it. I mean, I would have kept it, because, look	 Iran has the oil, and theyâ€™re going to have the oil, well, the stuff they donâ€™t have, because Iran is taking over Iraq as sure as youâ€™re sitting there. And Iâ€™ve been very good on this stuff. My prognostications, my predictions have become, have been very accurate, if you look.	
276	HIATT	 So what do you think Chinaâ€™s aims are in the South China Sea?		
278	Donald Trump	 Well I know China very well, because I deal with China all the time. Iâ€™ve done very well. Chinaâ€™s unbelievably ambitious. China is, uhâ€¦ I mean, when I deal with China, you know, I have the Bank of America building, Iâ€™ve done some great deals with China. I do deals with them all the time on, you know, selling apartments, and, you know, people say â€˜oh thatâ€™s not the same thing.â€™ The level ofâ€¦ uh, the largest bank in the world, 400 million customers, is a tenant of mine in New York, in Manhattan. The biggest bank in China. The biggest bank in the world.		
280	China has got unbelievable ambitions. China feels very invincible. We have rebuilt China. They have drained so much money out of our country that theyâ€™ve rebuilt China. Without us, you wouldnâ€™t see the airports and the roadways and the bridges; I mean, the George Washington Bridge is like, thatâ€™s like a trinket compared to the bridges that theyâ€™ve built in China. We donâ€™t build anymore, and it, you know, we had our day. But China, if you look at whatâ€™s going on in China, you know, they go down to seven percent or eight percent and itâ€™s like a national catastrophe. Our GDP is right now zero. Essentially zero.			
282	DIEHL	 Could you use trade to cause them to retreat in the South China Sea?		
284	Donald Trump	 I think so, yeah. I think so		
286	DIEHL	 What would you do?		
288	Donald Trump	 We, well, you start making it tougher. Theyâ€™re selling their products to us forâ€¦ you know, with no tax, no nothing. By the way, we canâ€™t deal with them, but they can deal with us. See, we are free trade. The story is, and I have so many people that deal with China â€“they can easily sell their product here. No tax, no nothing, just â€˜come on, bring it all in, you know, bring in your apples, bring in everything you makeâ€™ and no taxes whatsoever, right? If you want to deal with China, itâ€™s just the opposite. You canâ€™t do that. In other words, if you want to, if youâ€™re a manufacturer, you want to go into China? Itâ€™s very hard to get your product in, and if you get it in you have to pay a very big tax.		
290	HIATT	 So, if they occupied what the Japanese call the Senkaku Islands, is that something the United Statesâ€¦		
292	Donald Trump	 Well, I, you know, again, I donâ€™t like to tell you what Iâ€™d do, because I donâ€™t want toâ€¦ You understand what Iâ€™m saying, Fred? If Iâ€¦ Okay, if I say â€˜Well, we should go in and do this or that or that,â€™ I donâ€™t want to, I donâ€™t want to sort ofâ€¦ red flag all over it. I do think this	 Itâ€™s an unbelievable thing that theyâ€™ve done, itâ€™s unbelievable aggression, itâ€™s unbelievable lack of respect for this country.	
294	HIATT	 This theory of unpredictability, I want to push a little bit, I mean â€“ there are many people who think that North Korea invaded South Korea precisely because Acheson wasnâ€™t clear that we would defend South Korea. So Iâ€™m curious, does ambiguity sometimes have dangers?		
296	Donald Trump	 Well Iâll give you, Iâll give you an example. President Obama, when he left Iraq, gave a specific date â weâre going to be out. I thought that was a terrible thing to do.  And the enemy pulled back, because they donât want die.  Despite what you read, you know, they donât want to die â and they just pulled back, and after we left, all hell broke out, right? And Iâll give you another example that I think was terrible	 when they sent, a few months ago, they sent fifty troops in. You know, fifty elite troops. Now, why do we have to have a news conference to announce that weâre sending fifty troops? So those troops now have targets on their back. Andâ¦you shouldnât do it.  Weâre so predictable	 âLadies and gentlemen, weâre sending fifty troops into Iraq or Syria. And these are our elite troops. And theyâre going to do this and that and that and this.â And those troops now are being hunted. If you didnât send them, they wouldnât â if you didnât say that, they wouldnât know. I mean, there are times when you just canât beâ¦ You talk too much. We talk too much. I guess they thought that was good politically, to say weâre sending fifty troops? I donât think it was good.
298	LANE	 Can I ask youâ€¦Just going back to NATO, becauseâ€¦		
300	Donald Trump	 Yes.		
302	LANE	 As you know, the whole theory of NATO from the beginning  was to keep the United States involved in the long term in Europe to balance, to promote a balance of power in that region so we wouldnâ€™t have a repeat of World War I and World War 2. And it seems to be like what youâ€™re saying is very similar to what President Obama said to Jeffrey Goldberg, in that we have allies that become free riders. So it seems like thereâ€™s some convergence with the president there. What concerns me about both is that to some extent it was always thought to be in our interest that we, yes, we would take some of the burden on, yes, even if the net-net was not 100 percent, even steven, with the Germans. So Iâ€™d like to hear you say very specifically, you know, with respect to NATO, what is your ask of these other countries? Right, youâ€™ve painted it in very broad terms, but do you have a percent of GDP that they should be spending on defense? Tell me more. Because itâ€™s not that you want to pull the U.S. out.		
304	Donald Trump	 No, I donâ€™t want to pull it out. NATO was set up at a different time. NATO was set up when we were a richer country. Weâ€™re not a rich country. Weâ€™re borrowing, weâ€™re borrowing all of this money. Weâ€™re borrowing money from China, which is a sort of an amazing situation. But things are a much different thing. NATO is costing us a fortune and yes, weâ€™re protecting Europe but weâ€™re spending a lot of money. Number 1, I think the distribution of costs has to be changed. I think NATO as a concept is good, but it is not as good as it was when it first evolved. And I think we bear the, you know, not only financially, we bear the biggest brunt of it. Obama has been stronger on the Ukraine than all the other countries put together, and those other countries right next door to the Ukraine. And I just say we have, Iâ€™m not even knocking it, Iâ€™m just saying I donâ€™t think itâ€™s fair, weâ€™re not treated fair. I donâ€™t think weâ€™re treated fair, Charles, anywhere. If you look everything we have. You know, South Korea is very rich. Great industrial country. And yet weâ€™re not reimbursed fairly for what we do. Weâ€™re constantly, you know, sending our ships, sending our planes, doing our war games, doing other. Weâ€™re reimbursed a fraction of what this is all costing.		
306	LANE	  You know, well, they say and I think this is on public record, itâ€™s basically 50 percent of the non-personnel cost is paid by South Korea and Japan.		
308	Donald Trump	 50 percent?		
310	LANE	 Yeah.		
312	Donald Trump	 Why isnâ€™t it 100 percent?		
314	HIATT	 Well I guess the question is, does the United States gain anything by having bases?		
316	Donald Trump	 Personally I donâ€™t think so. I personally donâ€™t think so. Look. I have great relationships with South Korea. I have buildings in South Korea. But thatâ€™s a wealthy country. They make the ships, they make the televisions, they make the air conditioning. They make tremendous amounts of products. Itâ€™s a huge, itâ€™s a massive industrial complex country. And â€”		
318	HIATT	 So you donâ€™t think the US gains from being the force that sort of that helps keep the peace in the Pacific?		
320	Donald Trump	 I think that we are not in the position that we used to be. I think we were a very powerful, very wealthy country. And weâ€™re a poor country now. Weâ€™re a debtor nation. How you going to get rid â€“ let me ask you â€“ how are you going get rid of $21 trillion in debt? Youâ€™re going to be at 21 trillion in a matter of minutes because of that new omnibus budget. So they passed that ridiculous omnibus budget. How you going to get rid of that debt. Weâ€™re spending that to protect other countries. Weâ€™re not spending it on ourselves. Because we have, we have armor-plated vehicles that are obsolete. The best ones are given to the enemy. We give them to our allies over in the Middle East. A bullet shot in the air and they immediately run and the enemy takes over. I have a friend whose son is in his third, his third tour over in Iraq. Heâ€™s over in, I mean heâ€™s a very special kid, heâ€™s a great kid. But heâ€™s over in the Middle East, and, uh, Afghanistan, different parts of the Middle East, actually. And he said to me, I said to him what do you think. And he said, itâ€™s so sad. He said the enemy has our equipment â€“ the new version â€” and we have all the old version, and the enemy has our equipment, because they get into a fight with the so-called people like the Freedom Fighters, you know the whole Syrian deal, where weâ€™re sending billions and billions of dollars worth, and they capture the equipment. In most cases the shots are fired and everybody leaves. And these are the people weâ€™re backing. And we donâ€™t know if itâ€™s going to be another Saddam Hussein deal, in other words, letâ€™s get rid of Assad with these people and these people end up being worse. Okay? But he said, they have better equipment. Itâ€™s our equipment. They have, I guess we send 2,300 Humvees over, all armor-plated. So we have wounded warriors, with no legs, with no arms, because they were driving in stuff without the armor. And the enemy has most of the new ones we sent over that they captured. And he said, itâ€™s so discouraging when they see that the enemy has better equipment than we have â€“ and itâ€™s our equipment.		
322	HIATT	 Iâd like to come back to the campaign. You said a few weeks ago after a family in Chicago gave some money to a PAC opposing you, you said, âThey better watch out. They have a lot to hide.â What should they watch out for?		
324	Donald Trump	 Look, they are spending vicious â€¦ I donâ€™t even know these people. Those Ricketts. I actually said they ought to focus on the Chicago Cubs and, you know, stop playing around. They spent millions of dollars fighting me in Florida. And out of 68 counties, I won 66. I won by 20 points, almost 20 points. Against, everybody thought he was a popular sitting senator. I had $38 million dollars spent on me in Florida over a short period of time. $38 million. And, you know, the Ricketts, I donâ€™t even know these people.		
326	HIATT	 So, what does it mean, âThey better watch outâ?		
328	Donald Trump	 Well, it means that Iâ€™ll start spending on them. Iâ€™ll start taking ads telling them all what a rotten job theyâ€™re doing with the Chicago Cubs. I mean, they are spending on me. I mean, so am I allowed to say that? Iâ€™ll start doing ads about their baseball team. That itâ€™s not properly run or that they havenâ€™t done a good job in the brokerage business lately.		
330	RYAN	 Would you do that while you are president?		
332	Donald Trump	 No, not while I am president. No, not while Iâm president. That is two phases. Right now, look, you know, I went to a great school, I was a good student and all. I am an intelligent person. My uncle, I would say my uncle was one of the brilliant people. He was at MIT for 35 years. As a great scientist and engineer, actually more than anything else. Dr. John Trump, a great guy. Iâm an intelligent person. I understand what is going on. Right now, I had 17 people who started out. They are almost all gone. If I were going to do that in a different fashion I think I probably wouldnât be sitting here. You would be interviewing somebody else. But it is hard to act presidential when you are being â¦ I mean, actually I think it is presidential because it is winning. And winning is a pretty good thing for this country because we donât win any more. And I say it all the time. We do not win any more. This country doesnât win. We donât win with trade. We donât win with â¦ We canât even beat ISIS. And by the way, just to answer the rest of that question, I would knock the hell out of ISIS in some form. I would rather not do it with our troops, you understand that. Very important. Because I think saying that is very important because I was against the war in Iraq, although they found a clip talking to Howard Stern, I said, âWellâ¦â It was very unenthusiastic. Before they want in, I was totally against the war. I was against it for years. I actually had a delegation sent from the White House to talk to me because I guess I get a disproportionate amount of publicity. I was just against the war. I thought it would destabilize the Middle East, and it did. But we have to knock out ISIS. We are living like in medieval times. Who ever heard of the heads chopped off?		
334	HIATT	 Just back to the campaign. You are smart and you went to a good school. Yet you are up there and talking about your hands and the size of private â€¦		
336	Donald Trump	 No â€¦		
338	HIATT	 â€¦ your private parts.		
340	Donald Trump	 No, no. No, no. I am not doing that.		
342	HIATT	 Do you regret having engaged in that?		
344	Donald Trump	 No, I had to do it. Look, this guy. Hereâ€™s my hands. Now I have my hands, I hear, on the New Yorker, a picture of my hands.		
346	MARCUS	 Youâ€™re on the cover.		
348	Donald Trump	 A hand with little fingers coming out of a stem. Like, little. Look at my hands. Theyâre fine. Nobody other than Graydon Carter years ago used to use that. My hands are normal hands. During a debate, he was losing, and he said, âOh, he has small hands and therefore, you know what that means.â This was not me. This was Rubio that said, âHe has small hands and you know what that means.â Okay? So, he started it. So, what I said a couple of days later â¦ and what happened is I was on line shaking hands with supporters, and one of supporters got up and he said, âMr. Trump, you have strong hands. You have good-sized hands.â And then another one would say, âYou have great hands, Mr. Trump, I had no idea.â I said, âWhat do you mean?â He said, âI thought you were like deformed, and I thought you had small hands.â I had fifty people â¦ Is that a correct statement? I mean people were writing, âHow are Mr. Trumpâs hands?â My hands are fine. You know, my hands are normal. Slightly large, actually. In fact, I buy a slightly smaller than large glove, okay? No, but I did this because everybody was saying to me, âOh, your hands are very nice. They are normal.â So Rubio, in a debate, said, because he had nothing else to say â¦ now I was hitting him pretty hard. He wanted to do his Don Rickles stuff and it didnât work out. Obviously, it didnât work too well. But one of the things he said was âHe has small hands and therefore, you know what that means, he has small something else.â You can look it up. I didnât say it.		
350	MARCUS	 You chose to raise it â€¦		
352	Donald Trump	 No, I chose to respond.		
354	MARUS	 You chose to respond.		
356	Donald Trump	 I had no choice.		
358	MARCUS	 You chose to raise it during a debate. Can you explain why you had no choice?		
360	Donald Trump	 I donât want people to go around thinking that I have a problem. Iâm telling you, Ruth, I had so many people. I would say 25, 30 people would tell me â¦ every time Iâd shake peopleâs hand, âOh, you have nice hands.â Why shouldnât I? And, by the way, by saying that I solved the problem. Nobody questions â¦ I even held up my hands, and said, âLook, take a look at that hand.â		
362	MARCUS	 You told us in the debate â€¦.		
364	Donald Trump	 And by saying that, I solved the problem. Nobody questions. Everyone held my hand. I said look. Take a look at that hand.		
366	MARCUS	 You told us in the debate that you guaranteed there was not another problem. Was that presidential? And why did you decide to do that?		
368	Donald Trump	 I donâ€™t know if it was presidential, honestly, whether it is or not. He said, â€˜Donald Trump has small hands and therefore he has small something else.â€™ I didnâ€™t say that. And all I did is when he failed, when he was failing, when he was, when Christie made him look bad, I gave him theâ€“ a little recap and I said,  and I said, and I had this big strong powerful hand ready to grab him, because I thought he was going to faint. And everybody took it fine. Whether it was presidential or not I canâ€™t tell you. I can just say that what he said was a lie. And everybody, they wanted to do stories on my hands; after I said that, they never did. And then I held up the hand, I showed people the hand. You know, when Iâ€™ve got a big audience. So yeah, I think itâ€™s not a question of presidential â€¦		
370	MARCUS	 He said he regrets â€¦		
372	HIATT	 Okay, letâ€™s move on here. Letâ€™s move on.		
374	Donald Trump	 I did feel I should respond. Maybe Iâ€™m wrong. I donâ€™t know. But I felt I should respond because everybody was talking about it.		
376	RYAN	 You [MUFFLED] mentioned a few minutes earlier here that you would knock ISIS. Youâ€™ve mentioned it many times. Youâ€™ve also mentioned the risk of putting American troop in a danger area. If you could substantially reduce the risk of harm to ground troops, would you use a battlefield nuclear weapon to take out ISIS?		
378	Donald Trump	 I donâ€™t want to use, I donâ€™t want to start the process of nuclear. Remember the one thing that everybody has said, Iâ€™m a counterpuncher. Rubio hit me. Bush hit me. When I said low energy, heâ€™s a low-energy individual, he hit me first. I spent, by the way he spent 18 million dollarsâ€™ worth of negative ads on me. Thatâ€™s putting [MUFFLED]â€¦		
380	RYAN	 This is about ISIS. You would not use a tactical nuclear weapon against ISIS?		
382	[CROSSTALK]			
384	Donald Trump	 Iâ€™ll tell you one thing, this is a very good looking group of people here.  Could I just go around so I know who the hell Iâ€™m talking to?		
386	HIATT	 Sure, then Iâ€™d like to let a couple of them get in questions.		
388	LEWANDOWSKI	 We have got five minutes, hard out.		
390	HIATT	 Okay.		
392	Donald Trump	 Oh is it?		
394	CORY	 Yeah. You have a meeting you have to get to.		
396	Donald Trump	 Okay we do.		
398	ARMAO	 Iâ€™m Jo-Ann Armao. I cover D.C. events. I  want to ask you a question about what you think about D.C. voting rights or statehood.		
400	Donald Trump	 Okay. Iâ€™ll talk about that.		
402	TOM TOLES, EDITORIAL CARTOONIST	 Tom Toles.		
404	Donald Trump	 Hi, Tom.		
406	LANE	 Iâ€™m Charles â€¦		
408	Donald Trump	 Yes, I know Charles.		
410	STROMBERG	 Steve Stromberg, editorial writer.		
412	Donald Trump	 Right.		
414	MARCUS	 Ruth Marcus.		
416	Donald Trump	 Right.		
418	RYAN	  Fred Ryan.		
420	Donald Trump	 Right, right.		
422	DIEHL	 Jackson Diehl.		
424	Donald Trump	  Good.		
426	JAMES DOWNIE	 James Downie, digital opinions editor.		
428	Donald Trump	 Hi, James.		
430	MICHAEL LARABEE	 Mike Larabee, Iâ€™m the op-ed editor.		
432	Donald Trump	 Yes.		
434	CHRISTINE EMBA	 Christine Emba.		
436	Donald Trump	 Hi, Christine.		
438	JAMIE RILEY	 Jamie Riley, letters and local opinions.		
440	Donald Trump	 Good, yes, yes.		
442	KAREN ATTIAH	 Karen Attiah, deputy digital editor.		
444	HIATT	 Karen, you want to get a question in?		
446	ATTIAH	 Uh, yeah, I mean speaking again of the system of what a lot of people would say are some of the uglier components of your campaign; a lot of people have said youâ€™ve been running a very divisive campaign as far as racial divides, youâ€™ve noted you know your comments about Muslims, about Mexicans, immigrants and such. You have information that the country is becoming browner, is becoming younger, is becoming blacker. What in your vision of president, in your presidency, how would you bridge these divides and how will you address aâ€“ how are you going to run on a message of inclusion of all Americans?		
448	Donald Trump	 Well, first of all, if you look at some polls that have come out, Iâ€™m doing very well with African Americans. Iâ€™m doing, actually if you look at the polls, a lot of the polls that came out, in the, um, what do they call it? Exit polls, like from Nevada and other places, Iâ€™m doing very well with Hispanics.		
450	ATTIAH	 I think some of the polls are saying youâ€™re doing [in the] negatives.		
452	Donald Trump	 We do, if itâ€™s illegals, in other words, if itâ€™s everybody, but people that are legally living here, Iâ€™m doing very well. In other words, people that are here, like Hispanics that are in the country, Iâ€™m doing very well. People that vote. Like people leaving voting booths and all, Iâ€™m doing very well with them. I want to be inclusive, but at the same time, people should come here legally. They should be here legally. And I think the reason Iâ€™m doing, that I will do well, especially once I get started, donâ€™t forget I havenâ€™t even focused on Hillary yet. And, and as you know, you know Iâ€™ve had polls that are against me, but Iâ€™ve had many polls that say Iâ€™d beat Hillary, but theyâ€™re not that, that, they donâ€™t mean  anything now because itâ€™s too early. Because I havenâ€™t hit her. Iâ€™ve only hit her once, and that was eight weeks ago, but, I havenâ€™t started on Hillary yet, and when I do I think Iâ€™ll be able to make my  points. I mean, you know, but, but I think that just to try and answer your question	 Uh, I am the least racist person that you will ever meet. Okay. That I can tell you.	
454	ATTIAH	 But do you feel that your messages, your rhetoric, are dangerous and divisive for this country? How do you feel theyâ€™re â€¦.		
456	Donald Trump	 I donâ€™t think so. No, I donâ€™t think so. With the Muslim thing I think itâ€™s a serious problem. Iâ€™ve had Muslims call and tell me youâ€™re right with the Muslim thing, I think itâ€™s a serious problem.  And itâ€™s a problem that has to be addressed. I mean, thereâ€™s tremendous hatred. Even the, even the guy they caught in Paris. He was being hid out by other Muslims, and everybody is after him, and heâ€™s living right next to where he grew up.  Thereâ€™s a serious, serious problem with the Muslims and itâ€™s got to be addressed. Itâ€™s temporary, and itâ€™s got to be addressed. And you know you may think of it as negative. Many people think itâ€™s very positive.		
458	HIATT	 How would you identify people to keep them out of this country?		
460	Donald Trump	 Well look, thereâ€™s many exceptions. Thereâ€™s many â€“ everything, youâ€™re going to go through a process. But we have to be very careful. And I was really referring in particular, you know, to migrations â€“ Syrians, the whole migration, where weâ€™re going to take in thousands. And I heard in the Democrat debate, I heard 55,000, okay. 55,000. Now they say itâ€™s really ten [thousand], but itâ€™s already 10, and I just donâ€™t think we can take people into this country. You saw what two people did â€“ the woman and the man, whether she radicalized him or [inaudible] â€“ but you saw what two people did, and I just donâ€™t think we can take people in when we have no idea who they are, where they come from. Thereâ€™s no documents, thereâ€™s no paper, and we have ISIS looming over our head, and we have tremendous destruction. We lost the World Trade Center, we lost the Pentag â€“ you know, we had a plane go into the Pentagon, etc.		
462	ARMAO	 D.C.	 You told Chuck Todd last year on âMeet the Pressâ that you love D.C., you love the people, that you want to do whatâs best for them. They think whatâs best for them is statehood or at the very least voting rights. What is your position on those two things?	
464	Donald Trump	 I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C. I think itâ€™s a tough thing. I donâ€™t have a position on it yet. I would form a position. But I think statehood is a tough thing for D.C.		
466	ARMAO	 Tough politically?		
468	Donald Trump	 I think itâ€™s just something that I donâ€™t think Iâ€™d be inclined to do. Iâ€™d like to study it. Itâ€™s not a question really â€“ maybe Chuck didnâ€™t ask me like youâ€™re asking me â€“ I donâ€™t see statehood for D.C.		
470	ARMAO	 What about having a vote in the House of Representatives?		
472	Donald Trump	 I think thatâ€™s something that would be okay. Having representation would be okay.

477	HIATT	 Last one	 You think climate change is a real thing? Is there human-caused climate change?	
479	Donald Trump	 I think thereâs a change in weather. I am not a great believer in man-made climate change. Iâm not a great believer. There is certainly a change in weather that goes â if you look, they had global cooling in the 1920s and now they have global warming, although now they donât know if they have global warming. They call it all sorts of different things; now theyâre using âextreme weatherâ I guess more than any other phrase. I am not â I know it hurts me with this room, and I know itâs probably a killer with this room â but I am not a believer. Perhaps thereâs a minor effect, but Iâm not a big believer in man-made climate change.		
481	STROMBERG	 Donâ€™t good businessmen hedge against risks, not ignore them?		
483	Donald Trump	 Well I just think we have much bigger risks. I mean I think we have militarily tremendous risks. I think weâ€™re in tremendous peril. I think our biggest form of climate change we should worry about is nuclear weapons. The biggest risk to the world, to me â€“ I know President Obama thought it was climate change â€“ to me the biggest risk is nuclear weapons. Thatâ€™s â€“ that is climate change. That is a disaster, and we donâ€™t even know where the nuclear weapons are right now. We donâ€™t know who has them. We donâ€™t know whoâ€™s trying to get them. The biggest risk for this world and this country is nuclear weapons, the power of nuclear weapons.
