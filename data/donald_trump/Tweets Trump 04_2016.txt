I would rather run against Crooked Hillary Clinton than Bernie Sanders and that will happen because the books are cooked against Bernie! What a great evening we had. So interesting that Sanders beat Crooked Hillary. The dysfunctional system is totally rigged against him! .@oreillyfactor  Please correct, I WON Virginia! Thank you Indiana, we were just projected to be the winner. We have won in every category. You are very special people-I will never forget! Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain https://t.co/G4JlShRA6I Lyin' Ted Cruz consistently said that he will, and must, win Indiana. If he doesn't he should drop out of the race-stop wasting time &amp; money Wow, Lyin' Ted Cruz really went wacko today. Made all sorts of crazy charges. Can't function under pressure - not very presidential. Sad! MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!

Gov Mike Pence has just stated that Donald Trump has taken a strong stance on Hoosier jobs, and he thanks me! I will bring back jobs to USA. Crooked Hillary Clinton said she is used to "dealing with men who get off the reservation." Actually, she has done poorly with such men! I will be interviewed on @CNN  @NewDay  at 7:30 A.M. Enjoy!

Thank you Indiana! #Trump2016 https://t.co/WAuI0nRNzX Crooked Hillary Clinton, perhaps the most dishonest person to have ever run for the presidency, is also one of the all time great enablers!

I will be in Evansville, Indiana, with the great Bobby Knight (who last night endorsed me) at 12:00 this afternoon. See you there! Lyin' Ted Cruz, who can never beat Hillary Clinton and has NO path to victory, has chosen a V.P.candidate who failed badly in her own effort I will be interviewed on the @TODAYshow at 7:00 A.M. this morning. Enjoy! Thank you to all for the wonderful reviews of my foreign policy speech. I will soon be speaking in great detail on numerous other topics! "@AnnetteJeanne: I cried when they said you made a clean sweep of all 5 states. I was SO HAPPY! I really adore you Mr. Trump, so much."

Then to Pennsylvania for rest of day and night! Kasich just announced that he wants the people of Indiana to vote for him. Typical politician - can't make a deal work. Shows how weak and desperate Lyin' Ted is when he has to team up with a guy who openly can't stand him and is only 1 win and 38 losses. Lyin' Ted Cruz and 1 for 38 Kasich are unable to beat me on their own so they have to team up (collusion) in a two on one. Shows weakness! Lyin' Ted and Kasich are mathematically dead and totally desperate. Their donors &amp; special interest groups are not happy with them. Sad! Wow, just announced that Lyin' Ted and Kasich are going to collude in order to keep me from getting the Republican nomination. DESPERATION! I am happy to hear how badly the @nytimes is doing. It is a seriously failing paper with readership which is way down. Becoming irrelevant! "@DiamondandSilk: .@DonaldJTrumpJr awesome job on @CNNSotu.

https://t.co/Uyq4sTYb0l I met Prince on numerous occasions. He was an amazing talent and wonderful guy. He will be greatly missed! Cruz said Kasich should leave because he couldn't get to 1237. Now he can't get to 1237. Drop out LYIN' Ted. Both Ted Cruz and John Kasich have no path to victory. They should both drop out of the race so that the Republican Party can unify! Senator Ted Cruz has been MATHEMATICALLY ELIMINATED from race. He said Kasich should get out for same reason. I think both should get out! I will be doing the @TODAYshow with my wife, Melania, and the rest of my family in a major Town Hall. Hopefully, it will be fun! Enjoy.7A.M. Thank you Maryland- what a great way to conclude the day!

Lyin' Ted Cruz can't get votes (I am millions ahead of him) so he has to get his delegates from the Republican bosses. It won't work! Lyin' Ted Cruz will never be able to beat Hillary.
