.@TheView T.V. show, which is failing so badly that it will soon be taken off thr air, is constantly asking me to go on. I TELL THEM "NO" Hillary Clinton has been working on solving the terrorism problem for years. TIME FOR A CHANGE, I WILL SOLVE - AND FAST! "@TimVincent56:  @LindseyGrahamSC Talkers think about the future, Doers are already building it" #VoteTrump2016 https://t.co/OoB38jypsD" It is amazing how often I am right, only to be criticized by the media. Illegal immigration, take the oil, build the wall, Muslims, NATO! Remember when I recently said that Brussels is a "hell hole" and a mess and the failing @nytimes wrote a critical article. I was so right! These politicians like Cruz and Graham, who have watched ISIS and many other problems develop for years, do nothing to make things better! .@LindseyGrahamSC and Lyin' Ted Cruz are two politicians who are very much alike - ALL TALK AND NO ACTION! Both talk about ISIS, do nothing! It is amazing how @LindseyGrahamSC gets on so many T.V. shows talking negatively about me when I beat him so badly (ZERO) in his pres run! "@missi51: .@realDonaldTrump thank God is not a politician, but he's one heck of a fighter who will fight for us, the people." We pay a disproportionate share of the cost of N.A.T.O. Why? It is time to renegotiate, and the time is now! N.A.T.O. is obsolete and must be changed to additionally focus on terrorism as well as some of the things it is currently focused on!

I want to thank @RealSheriffJoe for all of his help in our historic Arizona win. Could not have done it without you Joe! While I believe I will clinch before Cleveland and get more than 1237 delegates, it is unfair in that there have been so many in the race! I think having Jeb's endorsement hurts Lyin' Ted. Jeb spent more than $150,000,000 and got nothing. I spent a fraction of that and am first! I will be the best by far in fighting terror. Iâ€™m the only one that was right from the beginning, &amp; now Lyinâ€™ Ted &amp; others are copying me. Just watched Hillary deliver a prepackaged speech on terror. Sheâ€™s been in office fighting terror for 20 years- and look where we are! Low energy Jeb Bush just endorsed a man he truly hates, Lyinâ€™ Ted Cruz. Honestly, I canâ€™t blame Jeb in that I drove him into oblivion! Lyinâ€™ Ted Cruz steals foreign policy from me, and lines from Michael Douglasâ€” just another dishonest politician. Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #TrumpTrain
https://t.co/MMPR0Omwog https://t.co/Dgqky0JiHO Lyin' Ted Cruz denied that he had anything to do with the G.Q. model photo post of Melania. That's why we call him Lyin' Ted! Hopefully the Republican Party can come together and have a big WIN in November, paving the way for many great Supreme Court Justices! Much bigger win than anticipated in Arizona. Thank you, I will never forget! Thank you, Arizona! #Trump2016
#WesternTuesday #TrumpTrain https://t.co/VMCzxrryG8 Incompetent Hillary, despite the horrible attack in Brussels today, wants borders to be weak and open-and let the Muslims flow in.  No way! Lyin' Ted Cruz just used a picture of Melania from a G.Q. shoot in his ad. Be careful, Lyin' Ted, or I will spill the beans on your wife! Pres. Obama should leave the baseball game in Cuba immediately &amp; get home to Washington- where a #POTUS, under a serious emergency belongs!

https://t.co/1Yak4I5B7b Mitt Romney is a mixed up man who doesn't have a clue. No wonder he lost! Failed Presidential Candidate Mitt Romney was campaigning with John Kasich &amp; Marco Rubio, and now he is endorsing Ted Cruz. 1/2 Failed presidential candidate Mitt Romney, the man who "choked" and let us all down, is now endorsing Lyin' Ted Cruz. This is good for me! Going to Salt Lake City, Utah, for a big rally. Lyin' Ted Cruz should not be allowed to win there - Mormons don't like LIARS! I beat Hillary Club for Growth letter- trying to extort $1,000,000.00 from me. Remember, I said- NO! https://t.co/suIfdiMg0Q Club For Growth tried to extort $1,000,000 from me. When I said NO, they went hostile with negative ads. Disgraceful! With millions of dollars of negative and phony ads against me by the establishment, my numbers continue to go up. Can anyone explain this? .@EWErickson got fired like a dog from RedState
and now he is the one leading opposition against me. Senator @LindseyGrahamSC made horrible statements about @SenTedCruz â€“ and then he endorsed him. No wonder nobody trusts politicians! Lyin' Ted Cruz lost all five races on Tuesday-and he was just given the jinx - a Lindsey Graham endorsement. Also backed Jeb. Lindsey got 0! Join us in Salt Lake City, Utah- tonight!

Great news that @FoxNews has cancelled the additional debate. How many times can the same people ask the same question?
