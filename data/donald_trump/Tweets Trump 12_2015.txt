THANK YOU Council Bluffs, Iowa! The silent majority, is silent no more!
#Trump2016 #FITN https://t.co/VTAe68eQ1k https://t.co/IPsJPVH5JP Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader wanted ads, lunches, donations, speeches from me, and tweets---very unethical. The great people of New Hampshire, who I love, are not properly served by the dying Union Leader newspaper. Shows how dumb Joe McQuaid (@deucecrew) of the dying Union Leader is to put out the letter I wrote saying why I didn't do his failed debate! New #ReutersPoll. Thank you America! 
#MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/oETsjV3aR4 I hope @TGowdySC does better for Rubio than he did at the #Benghazi hearings, which were a total disaster for Republicans &amp; America! We need a real President! https://t.co/nw7BIAW7HV Looking forward to being in Council Bluffs, Iowa, later today. Despite weather, rally is on -- will be fantastic! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain! So, I have spent almost nothing on my run for president and am in 1st place. Jeb Bush has spent $59 million &amp; done. Run country my way! My campaign for president is $35,000,000 under budget, I have spent very little (and am in 1st place).Now I will spend big in Iowa/N.H./S.C.

https://t.co/dTL7uybyeH https://t.co/yhQUQiuswl Thank you to a #Trump2016 supporter for this video of my campaign- over the past 6 months. Video: https://t.co/yawywElMwa Strange, but I see wacko Bernie Sanders allies coming over to me because I'm lowering taxes, while he will double &amp; triple them, a disaster! Wages in are country are too low, good jobs are too few,  and people have lost faith in our leaders.We need smart and strong leadership now! Many of the great jobs that the people of our country want are long gone, shipped to other countries. We now are part time, sad! I WILL FIX! The middle-class has worked so hard, are not getting the kind of jobs that they have long dreamed of - and no  effective raise in years. BAD If Hillary thinks she can unleash her husband, with his terrible record of women abuse, while playing the women's card on me, she's wrong! "@BornToBeGOP: @realDonaldTrump We need a real President to get things done, and that's why we want you!"  Thank you. Hopefully the Republican National Committee can straighten out the total mess that is taking place in Virginia's Republican Party. FAST! Straighten out The Republican Party of Virginia before it is too late. Stupid!

Lie! "@DavidSadler2525: @realDonaldTrump What's going on in VA? What's the GOP doing?  They will lose the state because of the RNC! Why are @JebBush flunkies  @ananavarro and @secupp, two of the dumbest people in politics, always on the @CNN panels..and yet Poll:Trump 39 The voters the Republican Party of Virginia are excluding will doom any chance of victory. The Dems LOVE IT! Be smart and win for a change! R.P.Virginia has lost statewide 7 times in a row. Will now not allow desperately needed new voters. Suicidal mistake. RNC MUST ACT NOW! It begins, Republican Party of Virginia, controlled by the RNC, is working hard to disallow independent, unaffiliated and new voters. BAD! "@LegacyRealtorsJ: You will come out tops Mr Trump. You are sincere, genuine, hard working, honest and willl DO WHAT YOU PROMISE THE  PEOPLE "@JimVitari: @realDonaldTrump @CAC8438 we need the change Trump is going to make, not the change Obama did by ruining the country" "@CAC8438: He supports amnesty and now they are so desperate that Trey Gowdy is going to campaign with him. "@mitchellvii: My prediction on the Trey Gowdy endorsement of Rubio is that it will do nothing for Rubio and finish Gowdy." "@mitchellvii: Face it, Trey Gowdy failed miserably on Benghazi. He allowed it to drag out and in the end, let Hillary get away with murder. "@Sir_Max: andreajmarkley: Rubio finally gets an endorsement ‚Äì from #Benghazi loser Gowdy #Tcot #pjnet https://t.co/lJcHG0IHaM via dailyne I will be interviewed on @foxandfriends at 8:00.

I will do far more for women than Hillary, and I will keep our country safe, something which she will not be able to do-no strength/stamina! Thank you! #Trump2016
https://t.co/CE9f0mukFm https://t.co/XNV9Bg2ccY Hillary Clinton has announced that she is letting her husband out to campaign but HE'S DEMONSTRATED A PENCHANT FOR SEXISM, so inappropriate! "@greta: If the insurance companies are making lots of money and the # of uninsured is still large,Obamacare is a failure since so expensive A new terror warning was issued for European cties.

Story: https://t.co/PBOKbGIaVB https://t.co/wm9Y7E9RzB Criminal deportations in the U.S. are the lowest number in many years. We are letting criminals knowingly stay in our country. MUST CHANGE! The Phoenix V.A., it has just been reported, is in worse shape than ever before. The wait is horrendous, and people are dying. I will fix it The same people that said I wouldn't run, or that I wouldn't lead or do well (1st place and leading by 21%), now say I won't beat Hillary. .@chucktodd is so dishonest in his reporting...and to think he was going off the air until I came along-no ratings. I will beat Hillary! @CNN just announced that TRUMP was #1 story of 2015. Totally meaningless, however, if we don't WIN IT ALL and Make America Great Again! "@deedeegop: Thank u Mr. Trump, I look forward to when u are elected next President of the United States #MakeAmericaGreatAgain. So nice!

"@ClassySnobbb: @realDonaldTrump @FoxNews I'm reading #CrippledAmerica! Best book ever. Thank you! When will the Democrats, and Hillary in particular, say "we must build a wall, a great wall, and Mexico is going to pay for it?" Never! Our great VETERANS are being treated very badly because of corruption and incompetence at the V.A. That will stop, I will fix this quickly! Remember when failed candidate @JebBush said that illegals came across the border as AN ACT OF LOVE? He's spent $59 million and is at 3%. We have many problems in our house (country!), and we need to fix them before we let visitors come over and stay. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! Does everyone see that the Democrats and President Obama are now, because of me, starting to deport people who are here illegally. Politics! .@deedeesorvino was GREAT today on @FoxNews  She gets what is going on in politics, and sees it very clearly. Have her on more! Merry Christmas to all. Have a great day and have a really amazing year. Together, we will MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! It will be done! .@danielhalper  Great job on @CNN today. Very wise indeed! .@HallieJackson Why didn't you report Hillary lying about the ISIS video. Bad reporting. Perhaps @NBC will do better next year-but doubt it! "@YesMrGilbert: @NBCNightlyNews @HallieJackson should have talked to Megyn Kelly about this story"  True, a total distortion of the facts! I am now in Palm Beach, Florida, and will be going to church tonight. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN! .@meetthepress and @chucktodd very dishonest in not showing the new @CNN Poll where I am at 39%, 21points higher than Cruz. Be honest Chuck! Why isn't @chucktodd using the much newer @CNN Poll when discussing how well I am doing instead of the older Q Poll? CNN even better! Wow, because of the pressure put on by me, ICE TO LAUNCH LARGE SCALE DEPORTATION RAIDS. It's about time! Next year will be an interesting one. I look forward to running against Hillary Clinton, a totally flawed candidate, and beating her soundly Third rate reporters Amy Chozick and Maggie Haberman of the failing @nytimes are totally in the Hillary circle of bias. Think about Bill! Wow, even lowly Rand Paul has just past @JebBush in the new @CNN Poll. Jeb is at 3%, I'm at 39%. Stop throwing your money down the drain! In the ridiculous @JebBush ad about me, Jeb is speaking to me during the debate, but doesn't allow my answer, which destroys him - SO SAD! Poor @JebBush spent $50 million on his campaign, I spent almost nothing. He's bottom (and gone), I'm top (by a lot). That's what U.S. needs! "@classyexplorer: @gatewaypundit Jim you fail to mention in your CNN POLL that in the GOP RACE...Trump is leading Cruz 39 to 18...Big Detail A great Christmas movie &amp; perfect #TBT! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain 
Story: https://t.co/qUpZphfhV3 https://t.co/PSeVbWUJIV "@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal." "@ihatematt: @realDonaldTrump why is Hillary even allowed to run... She's a criminal."  Good question! Hillary said "I really deplore the tone and inflammatory rhetoric of his campaign." I deplore the death and destruction she caused-stupidity Merry Christmas &amp; Happy Holidays!

https://t.co/XIVw5LdTqv https://t.co/Sqim2YyoCH Hillary, when you complain about "a penchant for sexism," who are you referring to. I have great respect for women. BE CAREFUL! It is hard to believe I am winning by so much when I am treated so badly by the media.  New @CNN Poll amazing in ALL categories. 21 pt. Lead Why does @FoxNews give @KarlRove so much airtime. He (and other Fox pundits) is so biased. Still thinks Romney won. Unfair coverage of Trump .@FoxNews treats me so badly. Using old Quinnipiac Poll where I have a much smaller lead than the just out @CNN Poll. All negative! The @washingtonpost, which is the lobbyist (power) for not imposing taxes on #Amazon, today did a nasty cartoon attacking @tedcruz kids. Bad The silent majority- is silent no more!

It is a shame that the biased media is able to so incorrectly define a word for the public when they know that the definition is wrong. Sad!

Often used word in politics! #MakeAmericaGreatAgain #Trump2016 https://t.co/TUDwrg6RsD Wow, new Reuters Poll just out. Big lead if you want to MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!  TRUMP 37  CRUZ 11 This is at the top of Drudge! RT @greenfield64: On further review, Trump is right on this. "I got schlonged" is a commonplace NY way of saying: "I lost big time," w/out ‚Ä¶ For those on TV defending my use of the word "schlonged," bc #MSM is giving it false meaning-tell them it means beaten badly. Dishonest #MSM NPR's @NealConan said "schlonged" to WaPo re: 1984 Mondale/Ferraro campaign: "That ticket went on to get schlonged at the polls." #Hypocrisy Once again, #MSM is dishonest. "Schlonged" is not vulgar. When I said Hillary got "schlonged" that meant beaten badly. Jeb's big ad buy against me, paid for by lobbyists, shows my face but doesn't have me answering Jeb's statements. He is really pathetic! Watching @CNN and consider @secupp to be one of the least talented people on television. Boring and biased! Women defy media narrative, love Trump at packed Michigan rally.

Do we want 4  more years of incompetent leadership?  MAGA! I demand an apology from Hillary Clinton for the disgusting story she made up about me for purposes of the debate. There never was a video. Hillary said at debate ISIS is "going to people showing videos in order to recruit more radical jihadistst." She made up story-want apology!
